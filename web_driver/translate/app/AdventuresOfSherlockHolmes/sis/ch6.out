HAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.

THE papers next day were full of the "Brixton Mystery," as they termed(把…叫作) it. Each had a long account(報導) of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings(剪報) and extracts(摘錄) bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--

The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister(邪惡的) inscription(題辭) on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration(犯罪) by political refugees and revolutionists(革命者). The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased(亡故者) had, no doubt, infringed(違反) their unwritten(不成文的) laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily(輕快地) to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing(告誡) the Government and advocating(主張) a closer watch over foreigners(外國人) in England.

The _Standard_ commented(評論) upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling(造成動盪的) of the minds of the masses, and the consequent(隨之而來的) weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu(再見) to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed(公開承認的) intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber's body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate(厄運), are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts(下落) of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged(忙於……的) upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated(預期) that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter.

The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism(專制者) and hatred(憎恨) of Liberalism(自由主義) which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent(苛刻的) code of honour, any infringement(違背規定) of which was punished(懲罰) by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to the acuteness(機敏) and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.

Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford(提供) him considerable(相當多的) amusement(樂趣).

"I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score."

"That depends on how it turns out."

"Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will be _on account_ of their exertions(努力); if he escapes, it will be _in spite_ of their exertions. It's heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers. 'Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire.'"

"What on earth is this?" I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering(急促的輕拍聲) of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied(伴隨) by audible expressions of disgust(厭惡) upon the part of our landlady.

"It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force," said my companion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged(衣服破爛) street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.

"'Tention!" cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels(流氓) stood in a line like so many disreputable(不正經的) statuettes(小雕像). "In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?"

"No, sir, we hain't," said one of the youths.

"I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your wages(報酬)." He handed each of them a shilling.

"Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time."

He waved his hand, and they scampered(（嬉鬧著快跑) away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill(刺耳的) voices next moment in the street.

"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars(乞丐) than out of a dozen of the force," Holmes remarked. "The mere(僅僅的) sight of an official-looking person seals(封口) men's lips. These youngsters(年輕人), however, go everywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation."

"Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?" I asked.

"Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain(弄清). It is merely a matter of time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance(報復)! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude(至上的幸福) written upon every feature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!"

There was a violent peal(大聲鳴響) at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room.

"My dear fellow," he cried, wringing(擰) Holmes' unresponsive(無反應的) hand, "congratulate(祝賀) me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day."

A shade of anxiety(擔心) seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face.

"Do you mean that you are on the right track?" he asked.

"The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key."

"And his name is?"

"Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty's navy," cried Gregson, pompously(自負的), rubbing his fat hands and inflating(使膨脹) his chest.

Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh(歎息) of relief, and relaxed into a smile.

"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars," he said. "We are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey(威士忌酒) and water?"

"I don't mind if I do," the detective answered. "The tremendous(巨大的) exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain(壓力) upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers."

"You do me too much honour," said Holmes, gravely. "Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying(心滿意足) result."

The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed(抽) complacently(自滿的) at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh(大腿) in a paroxysm(突發) of amusement.

"The fun of it is," he cried, "that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether(完全). He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time."

The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.

"And how did you get your clue?"

"Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered(主動提供) information. That is not Tobias Gregson's way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?"

"Yes," said Holmes; "by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road."

Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.

"I had no idea that you noticed that," he said. "Have you been there?"

"No."

"Ha!" cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; "you should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem."

"To a great mind, nothing is little," remarked Holmes, sententiously(說教式的).

"Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier's Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address."

"Smart--very smart!" murmured(低聲說) Sherlock Holmes.

"I next called upon Madame Charpentier," continued the detective. "I found her very pale(蒼白的) and distressed(煩亂). Her daughter was in the room, too--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled(顫抖) as I spoke to her. That didn't escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your nerves. 'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder(住宿生) Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.

"The mother nodded(點頭). She didn't seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.

"'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?' I asked.

"'At eight o'clock,' she said, gulping(大口大口地吸氣) in her throat to keep down her agitation. 'His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first.

"'And was that the last which you saw of him?'

"A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid(狂怒的). It was some seconds before she could get out the single word 'Yes'--and when it did come it was in a husky(沙啞的) unnatural tone.

"There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice.

"'No good can ever come of falsehood(說謊), mother,' she said. 'Let us be frank(坦誠的) with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.'

"'God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair. 'You have murdered your brother.'

"'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,' the girl answered firmly(堅決地).

"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.'

"'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to me, 'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation(焦慮) on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest(唯恐) he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly(徹底的) innocent(無辜的) of it. My dread(害怕) is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised(違背). That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents(前事) would all forbid(禁止) it.'

"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered. 'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'

"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and her daughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention(意圖) of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed(透露) it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting(省略) any particular.'

"'It is your wisest course(方向),' said I.

"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary(秘書), Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a "Copenhagen" label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved(拘謹) man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise(不然). He was coarse(粗俗的) in his habits and brutish(野蠻的) in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober(清醒的). His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly(使人反感的) free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude(心態) towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced(擁抱) her--an outrage(暴行) which caused his own secretary to reproach(責備) him for his unmanly(無男子漢氣概的) conduct.'

"'But why did you stand(容忍) all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish.'

"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent(直接相關的) question. 'Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said. 'But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack(冷清的) season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged(怨恨) to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going.'

"'Well?'

"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent(激烈的), and he is passionately(熱情的) fond of his sister. When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently(明顯地) the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent(語無倫次的) remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him. "You are of age," he said, "and there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare(額外的). Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess." Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist(手腕) and endeavoured(力圖) to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths(詛咒) and the confused sounds of a scuffle(短暫扭打). I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. "I don't think that fine fellow will trouble(使煩惱) us again," he said. "I will just go after him and see what he does with himself." With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber's mysterious death.'

"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps(喘息) and pauses(停頓). At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand(速記) notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake."

"It's quite exciting," said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn(打哈欠). "What happened next?"

"When Mrs. Charpentier paused," the detective(偵探) continued, "I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.

"'I do not know,' she answered.

"'Not know?'

"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'

"'After you went to bed?'

"'Yes.'

"'When did you go to bed?'

"'About eleven.'

"'So your son was gone at least two hours?'

"'Yes.'

"'Possibly four or five?'

"'Yes.'

"'What was he doing during that time?'

"'I do not know,' she answered, turning white to her very lips.

"Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass(銅管樂器的), 'I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,' he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding(間接提到) to it had a most suspicious(可疑的) aspect(觀點)."

"Very," said Holmes.

"He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout(厚實的) oak(橡木) cudgel(粗短棒)."

"What is your theory, then?"

"Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation(口角) arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent(蹤跡)."

"Well done!" said Holmes in an encouraging voice. "Really, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet."

"I flatter(使高興) myself that I have managed it rather neatly(整齊地)," the detective answered proudly. "The young man volunteered(自願提供) a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived(察覺) him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate(同船水手), and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he won't make much of. Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself!"

It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room. The assurance(自信) and jauntiness(輕鬆活潑的) which generally marked his demeanour(神態舉止) and dress were, however, wanting(缺乏的). His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged(弄亂) and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed(尷尬的) and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling(笨拙的) nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. "This is a most extraordinary case," he said at last--"a most incomprehensible(不能理解的) affair."

"Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!" cried Gregson, triumphantly(得意洋洋地). "I thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?"

"The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson," said Lestrade gravely, "was murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning."
