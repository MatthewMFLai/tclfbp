PART II. _ The Country of the Saints. _

CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.

IN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid(乾旱的) and repulsive(可憎的) desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier(屏障) against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation(荒涼) and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim(無情的) district. It comprises(包括) snow-capped and lofty(崇高的) mountains, and dark and gloomy(憂鬱) valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged(鋸齒狀的) cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline(含鹽的) alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness(貧瘠的), inhospitality(不好客的), and misery(痛苦).

There are no inhabitants(居民) of this land of despair(絕望). A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse(穿越) it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest(能吃苦耐勞的) of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome(令人驚懼的) plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote(（土狼) skulks(隱匿) among the scrub, the buzzard(美洲禿鷲) flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly(灰色的) bear lumbers(緩慢笨拙地移動) through the dark ravines(深谷), and picks up such sustenance(食物) as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole(唯一的) dwellers(棲身) in the wilderness.

In the whole world there can be no more dreary(陰鬱的) view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected(貫穿) by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral(叢林) bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits(頂峰) flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth -- above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence -- complete and heart-subduing silence.

It has been said there is nothing appertaining(有關聯) to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly(幾乎不) true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted(有車轍的) with wheels and trodden(踩) down by the feet of many adventurers(冒險家). Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten(閃亮) in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali(鹼). Approach(靠近), and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen(公牛), and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly(可怕的) caravan(旅行拖車) route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside(擱置).

Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary(單獨的) traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard(憔悴的), and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked(有斑點的) and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre(光澤); while the hand which grasped(抓緊) his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry(瘦而結實的) and vigorous(有力量的) constitution(體格). His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily(寬鬆下垂的) over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed(宣佈) what it was that gave him that senile(老態龍鍾的) and decrepit(老朽的) appearance. The man was dying -- dying from hunger and from thirst.

He had toiled(艱難緩慢地行走) painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation(高地), in the vain(徒然的) hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage(無情的) mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence(存在) of moisture(水分). In all that broad landscape there was no gleam(閃爍) of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag(懸崖), he was about to die. "Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence," he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.

Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl(披肩), which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly(立即，馬上) there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning(嗚咽聲) cry, and from it there protruded(伸出) a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled(淺凹) fists.

"You've hurt me!" said a childish(孩子氣的) voice reproachfully(譴責的).

"Have I though," the man answered penitently(懺悔的), "I didn't go for to do it." As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated(使脫離) a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty(小巧玲瓏的) shoes and smart pink frock(連衣裙) with its little linen apron(圍裙) all bespoke(定製的) a mother's care. The child was pale(蒼白的) and wan(顯得疲憊的), but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.

"How is it now?" he answered anxiously(掛念的), for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.

"Kiss it and make it well," she said, with perfect gravity(嚴重性), shoving [19] the injured part up to him. "That's what mother used to do. Where's mother?"

"Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long."

"Gone, eh!" said the little girl. "Funny, she didn't say good-bye; she 'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea, and now she's been away three days. Say, it's awful(令人極不愉快的) dry, ain't it? Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?"

"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient awhile, and then you'll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then you'll feel bullier. It ain't easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards lie. What's that you've got?"

"Pretty things! fine things!" cried the little girl enthusiastically(熱情的), holding up two glittering(光彩的) fragments(碎塊) of mica(雲母). "When we goes back to home I'll give them to brother Bob."

"You'll see prettier things than them soon," said the man confidently. "You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though -- you remember when we left the river?"

"Oh, yes."

"Well, we reckoned(想；認為，以為) we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But there was somethin' wrong; compasses(指南針), or map, or somethin', and it didn't turn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you and -- and ----"

"And you couldn't wash yourself," interrupted his companion gravely, staring up at his grimy(汙穢的) visage(臉龐).

"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother."

"Then mother's a deader too," cried the little girl dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing(嗚咽) bitterly(苦澀地).

"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped(長途跋涉) it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters. There's an almighty(十分嚴重的) small chance for us now!"

"Do you mean that we are going to die too?" asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.

"I guess that's about the size of it."

"Why didn't you say so before?" she said, laughing gleefully(歡欣地). "You gave me such a fright(驚嚇). Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with mother again."

"Yes, you will, dearie."

"And you too. I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher(壺) of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long will it be first?"

"I don't know -- not very long." The man's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks(小點) which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures(禿鷲) of the west, whose coming is the forerunner(預兆) of death.

"Cocks and hens," cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. "Say, did God make this country?"

"In course He did," said her companion, rather startled(受驚嚇的) by this unexpected question.

"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri," the little girl continued. "I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees."

"What would ye think of offering up prayer(禱文)?" the man asked diffidently(羞怯的).

"It ain't night yet," she answered.

"It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you bet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains."

"Why don't you say some yourself?" the child asked, with wondering eyes.

"I disremember(忘記) them," he answered. "I hain't said none since I was half the height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say them out, and I'll stand by and come in on the choruses(合唱部分)."

"Then you'll need to kneel(跪下) down, and me too," she said, laying the shawl out for that purpose. "You've got to put your hands up like this. It makes you feel kind o' good."

It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling(胡扯) child and the reckless(魯莽的), hardened adventurer(冒險者). Her chubby(豐滿的) face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt(衷心的) entreaty(懇求) to that dread(害怕) being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices -- the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh -- united in the entreaty for mercy(憐憫) and forgiveness(寬恕). The prayer(祈禱) finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose(憩息). Slowly the eyelids(眼皮) drooped(下垂) over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses(頭髮) of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber(睡眠).

Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge(邊；邊緣；邊沿) of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished(突出的) from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident(明顯的) that it could only be raised by a great multitude(許多) of moving creatures(生物). In more fertile(肥沃的) spots the observer would have come to the conclusion(結論) that one of those great herds(畜群) of bisons(野牛) which graze(吃草) upon the prairie(大草原) land was approaching(接近) him. This was obviously(明顯地) impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl(旋轉) of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff(峭壁) upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts(傾斜) of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen(騎手) began to show up through the haze(霧氣), and the apparition(幽靈) revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan(旅行隊)! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear(後部的) was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling(四散) array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable(無數的) women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled(蹣跚行走) beside the waggons or peeped(窺視) out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants(移民), but rather some nomad(遊牧部落中的一員) people who had been compelled(被迫的) from stress(壓力) of circumstances(情況) to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering(發出響亮的撞擊聲) and rumbling(發出隆隆聲) from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing(馬嘶聲) of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse(喚醒) the two tired wayfarers(徒步旅行者) above them.

At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre(嚴肅的) homespun(簡單樸實的) garments(衣服) and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted(停止), and held a short council(理事會) among themselves.

"The wells are to the right, my brothers," said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.

"To the right of the Sierra Blanco -- so we shall reach the Rio Grande," said another.

"Fear not for water," cried a third. "He who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon(離棄；放棄；拋棄；遺棄) His own chosen people."

"Amen! Amen!" responded the whole party.

They were about to resume(繼續) their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation(叫喊) and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From its summit(頂峰) there fluttered(飄動) a little wisp(一縷) of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining(勒住) up of horses and unslinging(由懸掛處取下) of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping(快速增加的) up to reinforce(增援) the vanguard(先頭部隊). The word 'Redskins(北美印第安人)' was on every lip.

"There can't be any number of Injuns here," said the elderly(年老的) man who appeared to be in command. "We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes(部族) until we cross the great mountains."

"Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson," asked one of the band.

"And I," "and I," cried a dozen voices.

"Leave your horses below and we will await(等候) you here," the Elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted(下馬), fastened(扣緊) their horses, and were ascending(上升) the precipitous(陡峭的) slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity(好奇心). They advanced rapidly and noiselessly(寂靜無聲地), with the confidence(把握) and dexterity(純熟) of practised scouts(偵察兵). The watchers from the plain below could see them flit(輕快地移動) from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment(驚愕), and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes.

On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder(巨石) there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive(過度的) thinness(骨瘦如柴). His placid(平和的) face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling(環繞) his brown sinewy(有力的) neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen(天鵝絨) tunic(（長袍). Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile(孩子氣的) features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles(扣環), offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled(乾枯) members of her companion(同伴). On the ledge(橫檔) of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn(嚴肅的) buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered(發出) raucous(刺耳的) screams of disappointment(失望) and flapped(振翅) sullenly(悶悶不樂的) away.

The cries of the foul(惡劣的) birds awoke the two sleepers who stared(凝視) about [20] them in bewilderment(混亂). The man staggered(大吃一驚的) to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate(荒無人煙的) when sleep had overtaken(追上) him, and which was now traversed(橫渡) by this enormous(巨大的) body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity(不相信的) as he gazed(凝視), and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. "This is what they call delirium(神智不清), I guess," he muttered(低聲嘀咕). The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning(審問) gaze of childhood.

The rescuing party were speedily able to convince(使信服) the two castaways(逃生到荒僻之地的人) that their appearance was no delusion(錯覺). One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted(抬起) her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt(憔悴的) companion, and assisted him towards the waggons(四輪貨運馬車).

"My name is John Ferrier," the wanderer explained; "me and that little un are all that's left o' twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o' thirst(渴，口渴) and hunger(饑餓感) away down in the south."

"Is she your child?" asked someone.

"I guess she is now," the other cried, defiantly(對抗的); "she's mine 'cause I saved her. No man will take her from me. She's Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though?" he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart(健壯的), sunburned(曬得很黑的) rescuers; "there seems to be a powerful lot of ye."

"Nigh(接近) upon ten thousand," said one of the young men; "we are the persecuted(迫害) children of God -- the chosen of the Angel Merona."

"I never heard tell on him," said the wanderer. "He appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye."

"Do not jest(笑話) at that which is sacred," said the other sternly(嚴厲地). "We are of those who believe in those sacred(神聖的) writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded(建造) our temple. We have come to seek a refuge(避難所) from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert."

The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections(回憶) to John Ferrier. "I see," he said, "you are the Mormons(摩門教徒)."

"We are the Mormons," answered his companions with one voice.

"And where are you going?"

"We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you."

They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims(朝聖者) -- pale-faced meek-looking women, strong laughing children, and anxious(掛念的) earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration(同情) which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution(一無所有的) of the other. Their escort(護送) did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon(四輪貨運馬車), which was conspicuous(顯眼的) for its great size and for the gaudiness(俗麗的) and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked(軛) to it, whereas the others were furnished(配備) with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute(堅定的) expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively(專心的) to an account of the episode(事件). Then he turned to the two castaways.

"If we take you with us," he said, in solemn words, "it can only be as believers(信徒) in our own creed(教義). We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay(衰敗) which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?"

"Guess I'll come with you on any terms," said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain(遏制) a smile. The leader alone retained his stern(嚴厲的), impressive expression.

"Take him, Brother Stangerson," he said, "give him food and drink, and the child likewise(也一樣). Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion(天堂)!"

"On, on to Zion!" cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled(波紋) down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking(嘎吱作響) of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.

"You shall remain here," he said. "In a few days you will have recovered(健康重新得到) from your fatigues(勞累). In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God."
