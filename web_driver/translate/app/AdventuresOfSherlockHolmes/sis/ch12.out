CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING(報復) ANGELS.

ALL night their course lay through intricate(錯綜複雜的) defiles(狹徑) and over irregular and rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope's intimate(諳熟的) knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous(絕妙的) though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed(褶邊) them in, peeping(偷看) over each other's shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch(落葉松) and the pine(松樹) seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling(猛衝) down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion(幻覺，幻想), for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse(（嘶啞的) rattle(連續短促的碰撞聲) which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled(受驚嚇的) the weary horses into a gallop(飛跑).

As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival(節日), until they were all ruddy(紅潤的) and glowing. The magnificent(壯麗的) spectacle(壯觀景象) cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt(暫停) and watered their horses, while they partook(吃) of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain(樂意的) have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable(不可阻攔的). "They will be upon our track by this time," he said. "Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives."

During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling(突出的) crag(懸崖), where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled(擠成一團的) together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity(怨恨) they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp(握緊) could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.

About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty(不足的) store of provisions(供給) began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness(不安), however, for there was game(獵物) to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook(隱蔽處), he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing(炙熱的) fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered(（拴動物的繫繩) the horses, and bade(致意) Lucy adieu(再見), he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching(蹲伏) over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the background. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view.

He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine(深谷) after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged(斷定) that there were numerous(很多的) bears in the vicinity(周圍地區). At last, after two or three hours' fruitless(無成果的) search, he was thinking of turning back in despair(絕望), when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill(興奮) of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting(突出) pinnacle(頂點), three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling(像) a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic(巨大的) horns(角). The big-horn -- for so it is called -- was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock(羊群) which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately(幸運地) it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived(察覺) him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle(來福槍) upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger(扳機). The animal sprang into the air, tottered(跌跌撞撞) for a moment upon the edge of the precipice(峭壁), and then came crashing down into the valley beneath(在下).

The creature was too unwieldy(笨重的) to lift, so the hunter contented(滿足) himself with cutting away one haunch(腰腿肉) and part of the flank(脅腹). With this trophy(獵獲物) over his shoulder, he hastened(加快) to retrace(沿原路返回) his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however(然而), before he realized(了解) the difficulty(困難) which faced him. In his eagerness(渴望) he had wandered(遊蕩) far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges(（通峽穀), which were so like each other that it was impossible(不可能的) to distinguish(區別) one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent(狂潮) which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced(確信的) that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly(快的), and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity(朦朧的) more profound(深沉的). Weighed down with his burden, and weary(疲倦的) from his exertions(努力), he stumbled(蹣跚而行) along, keeping up his heart by the reflection(反省) that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.

He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize(認出) the outline(外形) of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously(掛念的), for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo(喂) as a signal that he was coming. He paused(暫停) and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered(哐啷作響) up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague(（模糊不清的), nameless(不知名的) dread(害怕) came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically(瘋狂地), dropping the precious(珍貴的) food in his agitation(焦慮).

When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended(照顧) since his departure(離開). The same dead silence still reigned(主宰) all round. With his fears all changed to convictions(判罪), he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden(年輕女子), all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence(不在) -- a disaster which had embraced(包括) them all, and yet had left no traces behind it.

Bewildered(使迷惑) and stunned(目瞪口呆) by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially(本質上) a man of action, however, and speedily(迅速的) recovered(能力失而復得) from his temporary(短暫的) impotence(無能力). Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering(悶燃的) fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded(繼續進行) with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped(（重踏) down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives(逃亡者), and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded(說服) himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle(感到刺痛) within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap(一堆) of reddish soil, which had assuredly(肯定地) not been there before. There was no mistaking(誤解) it for anything but a newly-dug grave(埋葬處). As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft(裂口) fork of it. The inscription(銘文) upon the paper was brief, but to the point:

                        JOHN FERRIER,                  FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY,                     Died August 4th, 1860.

The sturdy(堅定的) old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph(悼文). Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers(追捕者) to fulfil(履行) her original destiny(命運), by becoming one of the harem(妻妾) of the Elder's son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate(厄運), and his own powerlessness(無力量的) to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.

Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy(無生氣) which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote(將…貢獻給) his life to revenge(替……報仇). With indomitable(不屈不撓的) patience and perseverance(堅持不懈), Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained(持續的) vindictiveness(報復性), which he may have learned from the Indians amongst(在……之中) whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate(孤寂的) fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage(緩和) his grief would be thorough(仔細的) and complete retribution(應得的懲罰), brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring(不知疲倦的) energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim(陰森的), white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle(束), and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.

For five days he toiled(艱難緩慢地行走) footsore(腳酸痛的) and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed(橫越) on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched(奪走) a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak(黎明) he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Cañon, from which they had commenced(開始) their ill-fated flight. Thence(從那裡) he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted(精疲力竭的), he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt(瘦削的) hand fiercely(猛烈地) at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed(注意到) that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity(慶祝活動). He was still speculating(猜測) as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter(哐啷作響) of horse's hoofs(蹄), and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered(提供) services at different times. He therefore accosted(上前搭訕) him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.

"I am Jefferson Hope," he said. "You remember me."

The Mormon looked at him with undisguised(不加掩飾的) astonishment(驚愕) -- indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered(破爛不堪的), unkempt(淩亂的的) wanderer, with ghastly(可怕的) white face and fierce(駭人的), wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity(身份), the man's surprise changed to consternation(驚惶失措).

"You are mad to come here," he cried. "It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant(逮捕狀) against you from the Holy Four for assisting(協助) the Ferriers away."

"I don't fear them, or their warrant," Hope said, earnestly(認真的). "You must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure(像變魔術般變出) you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God's sake(爲了幫助某人), don't refuse to answer me."

"What is it?" the Mormon asked uneasily. "Be quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes."

"What has become of Lucy Ferrier?"

"She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you."

"Don't mind me," said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. "Married, you say?"

"Married yesterday -- that's what those flags are for on the Endowment(捐款) House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?"

"Yes, I am off," said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled(稜角分明的) out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful(惡毒的) light.

"Where are you going?"

"Never mind," he answered; and, slinging(把…扔向) his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts(鬼魂經常出沒) of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.

The prediction(預言) of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined(形容枯槁) away and died within a month. Her sottish(酗酒的) husband, who had married her principally(主要地) for the sake of John Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement(喪失親人); but his other wives mourned(哀悼) over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial(葬禮), as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible(難以言傳的) fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments(衣服) strode into the room. Without a glance(一瞥) or a word to the cowering(蜷縮) women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping(腰背彎曲的) over her, he pressed his lips reverently(肅然起敬) to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding ring from her finger. "She shall not be buried in that," he cried with a fierce snarl(齜牙低吼), and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode(（一個事件), that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable(不可否認的) fact that the circlet(小圈) of gold which marked her as having been a bride(新娘) had disappeared.

For some months Jefferson Hope lingered(徘徊) among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire(渴望) for vengeance(報仇) which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird(怪異的) figure which was seen prowling(潛行) about the suburbs(城郊), and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet(子彈) whistled through Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion(時刻), as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder(巨石) crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions(考察) into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted(（被）領養的，（被）收養的) the precaution(預防措施) of never going out alone or after nightfall(傍晚), and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent(敵手), and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.

Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented(加強) it. The hunter's mind was of a hard, unyielding(不屈服的) nature, and the predominant(占主導地位的) idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical(實際的). He soon realized that even his iron constitution(體質) could not stand the incessant(沒完沒了的) strain(壓力) which he was putting upon it. Exposure(暴露於嚴寒而導致的凍傷) and want of wholesome(有益健康) food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake(突然降臨於) him if he persisted(持續). He felt that that was to play his enemy's game(玩戲), so he reluctantly(不情願的) returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit(徵募) his health and to amass(集聚）) money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation(貧困).

His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination(綜合) of unforeseen(意料之外的) circumstances(情況) prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving(渴望) for revenge were quite as keen(熱衷的) as on that memorable(難忘的) night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave. Disguised(偽裝的), and under an assumed(假冒的) name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings(消息) awaiting him. There had been a schism(教會分裂) among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled(（叛逆者) against the authority(管轄權) of the Elders, and the result had been the secession(脫離) of a certain number of the malcontents(不滿者), who had left Utah and become Gentiles(非猶太人). Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively(相對地) poor. There was no clue(線索) at all, however, as to their whereabouts(行蹤).

Many a man, however vindictive(懷恨在心的), would have abandoned(放棄) all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered(動搖) for a moment. With the small competence(能力) he possessed, eked(精打細算地維持) out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest(探索) of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled(頭髮灰白的), but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound(獵犬), with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable(可憐的) lodgings(借宿的地方) with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced(偶然), however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized(認出) the vagrant(流浪者) in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied(陪同) by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy(妒忌) and hatred(憎恨，) of an old rival(敵手). That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody(監護), and not being able to find sureties(擔擔保金), was detained(拘留) for some weeks. When at last he was liberated(解放), it was only to find that Drebber's house was deserted(空無一人的), and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.

Again the avenger had been foiled(挫敗), and again his concentrated(專心致志的) hatred urged(驅策) him to continue the pursuit. Funds(資金) were wanting(缺乏的), however, and for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching(臨近) journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked(追蹤) his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial(低賤的) capacity, but never overtaking(（超過) the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly(恰當地) recorded in Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.
