CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION(結論).

WE had all been warned(提醒) to appear before the magistrates(地方法官) upon the Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion(時機) for our testimony(（證詞). A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned(傳喚) before a tribunal(特別法庭) where strict(嚴厲的) justice(正義) would be meted(施加懲罰) out to him. On the very night after his capture(俘獲) the aneurism(動脈瘤) burst(破裂), and he was found in the morning stretched(伸直) upon the floor of the cell, with a placid(平和的) smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments(瞬間) to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done.

"Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death," Holmes remarked(評論), as we chatted(閒談) it over next evening. "Where will their grand advertisement(公告) be now?"

"I don't see that they had very much to do with his capture," I answered.

"What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence(後果)," returned my companion, bitterly(苦澀地). "The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind," he continued, more brightly, after a pause. "I would not have missed the investigation(偵查) for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive(有啟發性的) points about it."

"Simple!" I ejaculated(突然喊出).

"Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise(不然)," said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. "The proof of its intrinsic(根本的) simplicity(簡單) is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions(推論) I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal(罪犯) within three days."

"That is true," said I.

"I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide(指引) rather than a hindrance(阻礙). In solving a problem of this sort, the grand(首要的) thing is to be able to reason backwards(向後). That is a very useful accomplishment(成就), and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the everyday affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected(忽視). There are fifty who can reason synthetically(合成的) for one who can reason analytically(分析地)."

"I confess(承認)," said I, "that I do not quite follow(聽懂) you."

"I hardly expected(期待) that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe(描述) a train of events(事情) to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve(使逐步演變) from their own inner consciousness(意識) what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning(推論) backwards, or analytically."

"I understand," said I.

"Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour(努力) to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached(接近) the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely(徹底地) free from all impressions(印象). I naturally began by examining the roadway(路面), and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained(確定) by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge(口徑) of the wheels. The ordinary London growler(發出低沉的吼叫) is considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham(有篷四輪馬車).

"This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay(黏土) soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled(踐踏) line of slush(雪水), but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective(偵探) science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps(腳步). Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables(警官), but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated(徹底毀掉) by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal(夜間的) visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated(算計好的) from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably(時髦的) dressed, to judge from the small and elegant(高雅的) impression left by his boots.

"On entering the house this last inference(推斷) was confirmed(堅定的). My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound(傷口) upon the dead man's person, but the agitated(使焦慮) expression upon his face assured(保證) me that he had foreseen(預見) his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit(展示) agitation(焦慮) upon their features. Having sniffed(嗅) the dead man's lips I detected a slightly sour(酸的) smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred(增惡) and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion(排除), I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis(假說) would meet the facts(事實). Do not imagine that it was a very unheard(未被傾聽) of idea. The forcible(用暴力的) administration(施用) of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals(歷史記載). The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist(毒物專家).

"And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery(搶劫) had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics(政治活動), then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted(面對) me. I was inclined(傾向於…的) from the first to the latter(兩者中後者的) supposition(猜測). Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary(恰恰相反), been done most deliberately(故意地), and the perpetrator(行兇者) had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical(有條理的) revenge(報仇). When the inscription(銘文) was discovered(發現) upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion(意見). The thing was too evidently(明顯地) a blind(掩飾). When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind(提醒) his victim(遇難者) of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired(詢問) in his telegram(電報) to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber's former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative.

"I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished(配備) me with the additional details(詳細資料) as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle(掙扎), that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer's nose in his excitement(激動). I could perceive(注意到) that the track of blood coincided(幾乎同時發生) with the track of his feet. It is seldom(很少) that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded(冒險猜測) the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust(強壯的) and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.

"Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances(情況) connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive(確實的). It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival(競爭對手) in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure(設法得到) the murderer.

"I had already determined(已下決心的) in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered(遊蕩) on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd(荒謬的) to suppose that any sane(神智正常的) man would carry out a deliberate(（蓄意的) crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray(出賣) him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog(跟蹤) another through London, what better means could he adopt(採用) than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible(不可抗拒的) conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys(車夫) of the Metropolis.

"If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased(停止) to be. On the contrary(相反), from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw(引起) attention(注意) to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue(使繼續) to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed(假冒的) name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original(原先的) one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically(有系統的) to every cab proprietor(老闆) in London until they ferreted(搜尋) out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection(記憶). The murder of Stangerson was an incident(（事件) which was entirely unexpected(出乎意料的), but which could hardly in any case have been prevented(預防). Through it, as you know, I came into possession(擁有) of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised(猜測). You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences(順序) without a break or flaw(錯誤)."

"It is wonderful!" I cried. "Your merits(功績) should be publicly recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won't, I will for you."

"You may do what you like, Doctor," he answered. "See here!" he continued, handing a paper over to me, "look at this!"

It was the _ Echo _ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was devoted to the case in question.

"The public," it said, "have lost a sensational(絕妙的) treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed(瞭解情況) upon good authority(威信) that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud(世仇), in which love and Mormonism(摩門教徒) bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased(新近去世的人) prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency(效率) of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson(教訓) to all foreigners(外國人) that they will do wisely(明智的) to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit(功勞) of this smart capture belongs(屬於) entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials(官員), Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended(拘捕), it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur(（業餘從事者), shown some talent(天賦) in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain(獲得) to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial(證明) of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition(表彰) of their services."

"Didn't I tell you so when we started?" cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh. "That's the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!"

"Never mind," I answered, "I have all the facts in my journal(日記), and the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser

« Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo. Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca. » [The public hisses(發噓聲) at me, but I applaud(向……喝采) myself in my own house, and simultaneously(同時地) contemplate(仔細考慮) the money in my chest.]
