CHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES(回憶錄) OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.

OUR prisoner's furious(激烈的) resistance did not apparently(顯然地) indicate any ferocity(兇惡的) in his disposition(意向) towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable(友善的) manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle(短暫扭打). "I guess you're going to take me to the police station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. "My cab's at the door. If you'll loose(鬆) my legs I'll walk down to it. I'm not so light to lift as I used to be."

Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition(提議) rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and loosened(鬆開) the towel which we had bound round his ancles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure(使確信) himself that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned(曬得很黑的) face bore an expression of determination(決心) and energy which was as formidable(可怕的) as his personal strength.

"If there's a vacant(空著的) place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it," he said, gazing with undisguised(不加掩飾的) admiration(欽佩) at my fellow lodger. "The way you kept on my trail was a caution(謹慎)."

"You had better come with me," said Holmes to the two detectives.

"I can drive you," said Lestrade.

"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us."

I assented(同意) gladly, and we all descended together(一起). Our prisoner made no attempt(企圖) at escape(逃走), but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination(目的地). We were ushered(引導) into a small chamber where a police Inspector(督察) noted down our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder(謀殺罪) he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional(缺乏感情的) man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical(機械的) way. "The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week," he said; "in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you."

"I've got a good deal to say," our prisoner said slowly. "I want to tell you gentlemen all about it."

"Hadn't you better reserve(保留) that for your trial?" asked the Inspector.

"I may never be tried," he answered. "You needn't look startled(受驚嚇的). It isn't suicide(自殺) I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?" He turned his fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.

"Yes; I am," I answered.

"Then put your hand here," he said, with a smile, motioning(手勢) with his manacled(銬上) wrists towards his chest(胸膛).

I did so; and became at once conscious(感覺到) of an extraordinary(異常的) throbbing(顫動) and commotion(混亂) which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill(激動) and quiver(顫抖) as a frail(脆弱的) building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing(發嗡嗡聲) noise which proceeded from the same source.

"Why," I cried, "you have an aortic(大動脈) aneurism(動脈瘤)!"

"That's what they call it," he said, placidly(平和的). "I went to a Doctor last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst(破裂) before many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be remembered as a common cut-throat."

The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability(可取的) of allowing him to tell his story.

"Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate(立即的，立刻的) danger?" the former asked,

"Most certainly there is," I answered.

"In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty(自由), sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down."

"I'll sit down, with your leave," the prisoner said, suiting(對…方便) the action to the word. "This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle(扭打，) we had half an hour ago has not mended(修補) matters. I'm on the brink(邊緣) of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute(絕對的) truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence(後果) to me."

With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned(靠) back in his chair and began the following remarkable(非凡的) statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical(有條理的) manner, as though the events which he narrated(敘述) were commonplace(司空見慣的事) enough. I can vouch(擔保) for the accuracy(準確的) of the subjoined(增補) account(帳目), for I have had access to Lestrade's notebook, in which the prisoner's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered(表達).

"It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's enough that they were guilty(犯了罪的) of the death of two human beings -- a father and a daughter -- and that they had, therefore, forfeited(因違規而喪失) their own lives. After the lapse(間隔時間) of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction(判罪) against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge(法官), jury(陪審團), and executioner(行刑者) all rolled into one. You'd have done the same, if you have any manhood(男子氣概) in you, if you had been in my place.

"That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage(結婚) ring from her dead finger, and I vowed(發誓) that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished(懲罰). I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents(洲) until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die tomorrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire(渴望).

"They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner's office, and soon got employment(就業). I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom(很少) much over, but I managed to scrape(勉強獲得) along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon(認為) that of all the mazes(迷宮) that ever were contrived(人為的), this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal(最重要的) hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.

"It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired(查問) and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy(任由…的擺布). I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog(跟蹤) them and follow them until I saw my opportunity(時機). I was determined that they should not escape me again.

"They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels(腳跟). Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.

"They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall(傍晚). During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping(午睡). I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged(心灰意冷的), for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.

"At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently(不久) some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease(減輕), for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters(駐紮). At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise(除此之外). I got so close to them in the bustle(忙碌) that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion(同伴) remonstrated(抗議) with him, and reminded him that they had resolved(下定決心的) to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate(需要小心處理的) one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing(咒罵), and reminded(提醒) him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume(擅自) to dictate(命令) to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained(協議) with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station.

"The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly(一個一個地) they were at my mercy(慈悲). I did not act, however, with undue(過分的) precipitation(急躁). My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction(滿意) in vengeance(報仇) unless the offender(罪犯) has time to realize who it is that strikes(打擊) him, and why retribution(報應) has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged(冤屈) me understand that his old sin(罪過) had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged(從事……的) in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage(四輪馬車). It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate(複製) constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption(短暫中止). How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.

"He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor(酒) shops, staying for nearly half an hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom(有蓋雙座小馬車) just in front of me, and he hailed(向……呼) it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment(驚訝), we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine(想像；) what his intention(意圖) was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking."

I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.

"That's better," he said. "Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar(衣領), and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove(推撞) and a kick which sent him half across the road. 'You hound(卑劣的人),' he cried, shaking(搖動) his stick at him; 'I'll teach you to insult(侮辱) an honest girl!' He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed(毒打) Drebber with his cudgel(短棍), only that the cur(懦夫) staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private Hotel,' said he.

"When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing(權衡) in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted(空無一人的) lane have my last interview(面談) with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game(非法活動) was in my own hands.

"Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid(不易彎曲的) justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets(臨時住宿處) which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor(管理員) and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor(教授) was lecturing(（講座) on poisions, and he showed his students some alkaloid(生物鹼), as he called it, which he had extracted(提取) from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser(分配), so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble(可溶) pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw(抽籤) out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief(手帕). From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.

"It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak(淒涼的) night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal(憂鬱茫然的) as it was outside, I was glad within -- so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation(狂喜). If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed(（能記得久遠的) for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar(雪茄煙), and puffed(吸煙) at it to steady(穩固的) my nerves, but my hands were trembling(（發抖), and my temples(太陽穴) throbbing with excitement(興奮). As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.

"There was not a soul(靈魂) to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled(擠成一團的) together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, 'It's time to get out,' I said.

"'All right, cabby,' said he.

"I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.

"'It's infernally(壞透的) dark,' said he, stamping about.

"'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who am I?'

"He gazed(凝視) at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse(使抽搐) his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid(烏青色的) face, and I saw the perspiration(汗) break out upon his brow(額頭), while his teeth chattered(使卡嗒卡嗒作聲) in his head. At the sight, I leaned(傾斜) my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment(滿足的) of soul which now possessed(擁有) me.

"'You dog(狗)!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see tomorrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses(脈搏) in my temples beat like sledgehammers(大鎚), and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed(湧出) from my nose and relieved(解脫的) me.

"'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. 'Punishment(懲罰) has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward(膽小鬼) lips tremble(（顫抖) as I spoke. He would have begged(乞討) for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.

"'Would you murder me?' he stammered.

"'There is no murder,' I answered. 'Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling(寶貝), when you dragged(拽) her from her slaughtered(屠宰) father, and bore her away to your accursed(可惡的) and shameless(無恥的) harem(妻妾).'

"'It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.

"'But it was you who broke her innocent(天真的) heart,' I shrieked(尖叫), thrusting(猛推) the box before him. 'Let the high God judge between us. Choose(選擇) and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.'

"He cowered(退縮) away with wild cries and prayers(禱詞) for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed(服從) me. Then I swallowed(吞下) the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs(一陣劇痛) told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm(痙攣) of pain contorted(使扭曲) his features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse(嘶啞的) cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!

"The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice(注意) of it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous(愛惡作劇的) idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful(興高采烈的). I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled(迷惑的) the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient(方便的) place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy's ring, and found that it was not there. I was thunderstruck(目瞪口呆的) at this, for it was the only memento(紀念物) that I had of her. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped(俯身) over Drebber's body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house -- for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm(解除) his suspicions(猜疑) by pretending(佯裝) to be hopelessly(徹底地) drunk.

"That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier's debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday's Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. Fancy that he suspected(有嫌疑的) something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance(出現). He was cunning(狡猾的), was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken(弄錯). I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage(有利條件) of some ladders(梯子) which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn(黎明). I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber's death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned(毒) pills(藥丸). Instead of grasping(（攫取) at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In self defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for Providence(天意) would never have allowed his guilty(內疚的) hand to pick out anything but the poison.

"I have little more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged(衣服破爛的) youngster asked if there was a cabby(司機) there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets(手鐲) on my wrists, and as neatly snackled(束縛) as ever I saw in my life. That's the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are."

So thrilling had the man's narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed(全神貫注於…). Even the professional(職業) detectives(偵探), _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man's story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness(寂靜的) which was only broken by the scratching(劃) of Lestrade's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand(速記) account(記述).

"There is only one point on which I should like a little more information," Sherlock Holmes said at last. "Who was your accomplice(同謀) who came for the ring which I advertised(登廣告)?"

The prisoner winked(使眼色) at my friend jocosely(滑稽的). "I can tell my own secrets," he said, "but I don't get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My friend volunteered(自願參加) to go and see. I think you'll own he did it smartly(迅速有力地)."

"Not a doubt of that," said Holmes heartily(完全地).

"Now, gentlemen," the Inspector remarked gravely, "the forms of the law must be complied(遵守) with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates(地方法官), and your attendance(（到場) will be required. Until then I will be responsible for him." He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders(獄吏), while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.
