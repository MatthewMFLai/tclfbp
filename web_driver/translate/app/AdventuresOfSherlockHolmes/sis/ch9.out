CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH.

THIS is not the place to commemorate(紀念) the trials and privations(貧困) endured(忍受) by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven(和平之地). From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy(恆久不變) almost unparalleled(無比的) in history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue(疲憊), and disease -- every impediment(障礙) which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity(堅持). Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest(頑強的) among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt(衷心的) prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath(在下) them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.

Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute(堅決的) chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned(分配) and allotted(（分派) in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman(工匠) was put to his trade and the artisan(手藝人) to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered(昌盛) in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple(神殿) which they had erected(建造) in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp(用銼刀銼) of the saw was never absent from the monument(紀念館) which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.

The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage(朝聖). Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly(親切友好的) enough in Elder Stangerson's waggon, a retreat(僻靜處) which she shared with the Mormon's three wives and with his son, a headstrong(任性的) forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity(順應性) of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother's death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled(使一致) herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished(突出的) himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable(不倦的) hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem(尊敬) of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously(一致通過的) agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.

On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial(可觀的) log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy(寬敞的) villa(花園住宅). He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution(體格) enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling(耕作) his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.

There was one way and only one in which he offended(冒犯) the susceptibilities(感情豐富的) of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce(勸說) him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent(執意的) refusal, but contented(滿足) himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering(黏附) to his determination. There were some who accused(譴責) him of lukewarmness(不熱情的) in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed(貪婪) of wealth and reluctance(不情願) to incur(招致) expense(耗費). Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined(憔悴) away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate(禁慾的). In every other respect he conformed(順從) to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox(傳統的) and straight-walking man.

Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings(從事). The keen(熱衷的) air of the mountains and the balsamic(葡萄醋) odour(氣味) of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer(徒步旅行者) upon the high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive(使復原) in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father's mustang(野馬), and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed(變得更有魅力) into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.

It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom(很少) is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle(隱約的) and too gradual(逐漸的) to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded(預示…的開始) the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny(命運) and that of many besides.

It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive(蜂巢) they have chosen for their emblem(象徵). In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum(嗡嗡作響) of human industry(勤勞). Down the dusty high roads defiled(玷污) long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves(一群) of sheep and bullocks(閹牛) coming in from the outlying pasture(牧場) lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary(疲倦的) of their interminable(無休止的) journey. Through all this motley(混雜的) assemblage(一群動物), threading(穿過) her way with the skill of an accomplished(熟練的) rider, there galloped(騎馬奔馳) Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission(職務) from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness(無畏的) of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed(凝視) after her in astonishment(驚訝), and even the unemotional(不易動感情的) Indians, journeying in with their pelties(毛皮), relaxed their accustomed(習慣的) stoicism(隱忍) as they marvelled(（驚歎) at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.

She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience(不耐煩) she endeavoured(力圖) to pass this obstacle(障礙) by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely(剛…就) had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded(把…牢牢嵌入) in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity(時機) to urge(驅策) her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade(遊行隊伍). Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident(意外) or design(意圖), came in violent(猛烈的) contact with the flank(脅腹) of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind(身體後部的) legs with a snort(噴鼻息) of rage(一陣盛怒), and pranced(騰跳) and tossed(拋) in a way that would have unseated(使從馬上摔下) any but a most skilful(熟練的) rider. The situation was full of peril(巨大的危險). Every plunge(下跌) of the excited horse brought it against the horns(角) again, and goaded(激怒) it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle(馬鞍), yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs(蹄) of the unwieldy(笨重的) and terrified animals. Unaccustomed(不習慣的) to sudden emergencies(緊急情況), her head began to swim(暈眩), and her grip upon the bridle(馬勒) to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned(放棄) her efforts in despair, but for a kindly(仁慈地) voice at her elbow which assured(有保證的) her of assistance(援助). At the same moment a sinewy(肌肉發逹的) brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb(勒馬繩), and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts(郊外).

"You're not hurt, I hope, miss," said her preserver(保護), respectfully(恭敬的).

She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily(粗魯的). "I'm awful frightened," she said, naively(天真的); "whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?"

"Thank God you kept your seat," the other said earnestly(誠摯的). He was a tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan(毛色斑雜的馬) horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle(來福槍) slung over his shoulders. "I guess you are the daughter(女兒) of John Ferrier," he remarked, "I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he's the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick(很友好的)."

"Hadn't you better come and ask yourself?" she asked, demurely(端莊的).

The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled(用眼神表示 with pleasure. "I'll do so," he said, "we've been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as he finds us."

"He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I," she answered, "he's awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he'd have never got over it."

"Neither would I," said her companion(同伴).

"You! Well, I don't see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain't even a friend of ours."

The young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy(沮喪) over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud(出聲地).

"There, I didn't mean that," she said; "of course, you are a friend now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won't trust me with his business any more. Goodbye!"

"Goodbye," he answered, raising his broad sombrero(闊邊帽), and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust.

Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn(沉默寡言的). He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting(探勘) for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes(礦脈) which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred(攪動) his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished(消失的) from his sight, he realized that a crisis(緊要關頭) had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations(投機) nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion(強烈情感) of a man of strong will and imperious(跋扈的) temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance(不屈不撓) could render(使成為) him successful(成功的).

He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar(常見的) one at the farm-house. John, cooped(感覺受拘禁的) up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer(先驅) in California, and could narrate(敘述) many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon(昔日美好的時光) days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper(（捕獸者), a silver explorer, and a ranchman(大牧場工人). Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite(受寵的人) with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently(有說服力的) of his virtues(高尚品德). On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing(臉紅) cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly(肯定地) not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections(愛慕).

It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.

"I am off, Lucy," he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly(溫柔的) down into her face; "I won't ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?"

"And when will that be?" she asked, blushing and laughing.

"A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my darling. There's no one who can stand between us."

"And how about father?" she asked.

"He has given his consent(允許), provided we get these mines working all right. I have no fear on that head."

"Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's no more to be said," she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.

"Thank God!" he said, hoarsely(嘶啞的), stooping(彎曲的) and kissing her. "It is settled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the cañon. Goodbye, my own darling -- goodbye. In two months you shall see me."

He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging(猛扔) himself upon his horse, galloped furiously(猛烈地) away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance(一瞥) at what he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah.
