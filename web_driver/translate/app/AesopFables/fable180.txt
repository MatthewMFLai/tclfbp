Fable 180

The Jar Goes to Court

There was a woman of Sybaris who broke a jar. The jar then got someone to testify as a witness, but the woman of Sybaris said, ‘I swear by the Maiden, you would have been far wiser if you’d gone right away to get a bandage, instead of making a court-case out of it.’

NOTE : Sybaris was a Greek city in southern Italy which was associated with a particular type of joking story, called a ‘Sybaritic’ fable (see Fable 344 for another example). ‘The Maiden’ (in Greek, Kore) was a cult name of Persephone, who was celebrated at the Eleusinian Mysteries, together with her mother Demeter.
