Fable 179

The Wolf, the Fox, and the Monkey

Once you get a reputation for dirty tricks, nobody is going to take you seriously, even if you are telling the truth, as one of Aesop’s fables attests.

The wolf had accused the fox of theft but the fox denied that she was guilty of the crime. The presiding judge was a monkey. Both of the plaintiffs pleaded their cases and the monkey is then said to have pronounced the following verdict: ‘As for you, wolf, I do not believe you lost the goods claimed in your suit; as for you, fox, I am convinced you stole the goods, no matter how firmly you deny it.’
