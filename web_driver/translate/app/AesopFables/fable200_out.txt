Fable 200

The Fir(樅) Tree and the Bramble(黑莓灌木) Bush

The fir tree and the bramble bush were quarrelling(爭吵) with one another. The fir tree sang her own praises(讚揚) at length. ‘I am beautiful and attractively(引人注目地) tall. I grow straight up, a neighbour(鄰居) to the clouds. I supply the hall’s roof(屋頂) and the ship’s keel(船的龍骨). How can you compare yourself, you mere(只不過的) thorn(荊棘), to such a tree as myself?’ The bramble bush then said to the tree, ‘Just remember the axes(斧) which are always chopping(砍) away at you! Then even you can understand that it is better to be a bramble bush.’

A famous man has more glory(讚頌) than lesser(次要的) people, but he is also exposed(暴露) to greater dangers.
