Fable 196

The Sow(母豬), the Dog, and Their Litters

A sow and a dog were arguing about their litters(產仔). The dog said that she had the easiest delivery of all the four-footed animals but the sow responded, ‘Be that as it may, the puppies you give birth to are blind(盲的)!’

The fable shows that an enterprise(企業) is not to be judged in terms of its speed but its outcome(結果).

NOTE : The dog’s blind puppies were proverbial(俗話所說的) in Greek: ‘the dog gives birth in a hurry but her pups are born blind’ (Erasmus, Adages 2.2.35).
