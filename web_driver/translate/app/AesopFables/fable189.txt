Fable 189

The Fox and the Crocodile

The fox and the crocodile were disputing about their pedigrees. The crocodile was proudly enumerating the eminent qualities of his ancestors, and when he said that they had been the highest-ranking athletic officials, the fox remarked, ‘My dear sir, even if you had not mentioned it, the mere condition of your skin is evidence enough that you have suffered long years of athletic sports out of doors in the sun!’

NOTE : The joke is based on the crocodile boasting that his ancestors had been ‘Gymnasiarchs’, city officials who presided over the athletic gymnasiums in ancient Greece.
