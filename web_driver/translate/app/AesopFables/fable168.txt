Fable 168

The Murderer and the Nile

A man had committed a murder and was being pursued by the victim’s relatives. He
reached the river Nile, and when he found a lion there he was afraid and climbed up a tree; in the tree, he saw a snake and was practically scared to death, so he threw himself into the river, where a crocodile devoured him.The story is for people who commit murders: neither earth nor air nor water nor any other place will be able to protect them.

NOTE : Other versions of this fable (included in Chambry’s first edition of the Greek fables) feature a wolf instead of a lion.
