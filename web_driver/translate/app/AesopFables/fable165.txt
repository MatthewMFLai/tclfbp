Fable 165
The Lion and the Two Men

A lion was standing over a young bull whom he had killed when a robber showed up and demanded a part of the spoils. ‘I would agree,’ the lion said, ‘if you were not already in the habit of taking whatever you want!’ Thus, the lion refused the villain’s request. Meanwhile, an innocent wayfarer also happened upon the very same spot, although he backed away as soon as he saw the ferocious lion. ‘There is nothing to be afraid of,’ the lion said to him in kindly tones. ‘Please, take without hesitation the portion of this prize that your modesty has earned for you.’ He then divided the bull into pieces and went away into the woods, so that the man would come forward freely.

This is an altogether outstanding and admirable model of behaviour; in the real world, however, greed grows wealthy while honesty goes unrewarded.
