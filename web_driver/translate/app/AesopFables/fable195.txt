Fable 195

The Sow and the Lioness

The story goes that a sow who had delivered a whole litter of piglets loudly accosted a lioness. ‘How many children do you breed?’ asked the sow. ‘I breed only one,’ said the lioness, ‘but he is very well bred!’

The fable shows that a single man who is remarkable for physical strength and bravery and wisdom is mightier than many weak and foolish people.
