Fable 167

The Murderer(謀殺犯) and the Mulberry(桑樹) Tree

A robber had murdered someone along the road. When the bystanders(旁觀者) began to chase him, he dropped the bloody(血腥的) corpse(（屍體) and ran away. Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he had stained(…污染的) his hands. The man said that he had just climbed down from a mulberry tree, but as he was speaking, his pursuers(追捕者) caught up with him. They seized(抓住) the murderer and crucified(把……的手腳釘在十字架上處死) him on a mulberry tree. The tree said to him, ‘It does not trouble me at all to assist(幫助) in your execution(處死), since you tried to smear(誹謗) me with the murder that you yourself committed(犯罪)!’

It often happens that even honest(誠實的) people do not hesitate(猶豫) to persecute(迫害) someone who has slandered(詆毀) them.
