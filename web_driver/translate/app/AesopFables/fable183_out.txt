Fable 183

The North Wind and the Sun

The Sun and the North Wind were quarrelling(爭吵) with each other as to which of the two of them would be able to make a man disrobe(脫去……的衣服). The North Wind went first, blowing fiercely(兇猛地) against the man. Yet as the man grew colder and colder, he only wrapped himself up more snugly(貼身地) in his cloak(斗篷), clutching(緊抓) at it tightly so as to keep a firm grip no matter how hard the wind might be blowing. Thus the North Wind did the man no harm at all and failed to make him strip(除去) off his clothes. Next, the Sun began to shine upon the man so brightly that the very air of the day grew hotter and hotter. The man immediately took off his cloak and bundled(捆) it up on his shoulders.

The fable shows that to take a humble(謙虛的) approach is always more effective and practical than making empty boasts(自吹自擂).
