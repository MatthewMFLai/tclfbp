Fable 202

The Oak(橡樹) Tree and the Reed(蘆葦)

A story about a reed and an oak, urging(力勸) us not to rely on strength.

A reed got into an argument with an oak tree. The oak tree marvelled(（驚歎) at her own strength, boasting(吹噓) that she could stand her own in a battle against the winds. Meanwhile(與此同時), she condemned(宣佈爲危樓的) the reed for being weak, since he was naturally inclined(傾向於…的) to yield(受壓彎曲) to every breeze. The wind then began to blow very fiercely(猛烈地). The oak tree was torn up by her roots and toppled(使倒塌) over, while the reed was left bent but unharmed.

Those who adapt(適應不同情況) to the times will emerge(存活下來) unscathed(未受傷的).
