Fable 189

The Fox and the Crocodile(鱷魚)

The fox and the crocodile were disputing about their pedigrees(血統). The crocodile was proudly(自豪地) enumerating(列舉) the eminent(顯赫的) qualities of his ancestors(祖先), and when he said that they had been the highest-ranking athletic(擅長運動的) officials, the fox remarked, ‘My dear sir, even if you had not mentioned it, the mere(僅僅的) condition of your skin is evidence enough that you have suffered long years of athletic sports out of doors in the sun!’

NOTE : The joke is based on the crocodile boasting(自吹自擂) that his ancestors had been ‘Gymnasiarchs’, city officials who presided(主持) over the athletic gymnasiums(體育館) in ancient Greece.
