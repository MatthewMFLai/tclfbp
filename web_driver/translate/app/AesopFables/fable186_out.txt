Fable 186

The Lion and the Man Disputing(爭執)

A story about a lion and a man, urging(敦促) us to be honest and to refrain(避免) from boasting. A man and a lion were arguing. The man proclaimed(宣佈) the superiority(優越) of the human race, while the lion argued on behalf of his own kind. As they were contending(競爭) with one another as to who was superior, the man produced as evidence(證據) the statue(雕像) of a lion being defeated by a man. The lion retorted, ‘And if there were also sculptors(雕刻家) among us lions, you would see more people being conquered by lions than lions by people!’ One who deals with others honestly will win the victory(勝利).
