Fable 171

Hermes(【希神】赫密士), the Man, and the Ants

There was once a ship that sank with all hands on board. A man who saw what had happened said that the gods’ judgement(裁判) was unfair(不公平的): because of just one sinner(罪人) who was on board the ship, many men had died together with him, even though they were innocent(無辜的). While the man was speaking, a swarm(一大群) of ants started crawling(緩慢移動) over him as they rushed in their usual frenzy(狂熱) to feed on some bits of wheat chaff(穀殼). When one of the ants bit the man, he proceeded(開始) to trample(踐踏) a considerable(相當多的) number of them underfoot(在腳下). Hermes then appeared and struck the man with his wand(棒) as he said, ‘So, are you going to let the gods pass judgement on you humans just as you have passed judgement on the ants?’

NOTE : The god Hermes carried a special wand in his role as a messenger and herald(（傳令官) of the gods, in addition to his famous winged(有…翼的) sandals(涼鞋).
