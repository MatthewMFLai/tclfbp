Fable 184

Winter and Spring

Winter made fun of Spring and mocked(嘲笑) her for the fact that as soon as spring appears, nobody can keep still: some people go off to the meadows(草地) or into the woods(樹林), others like to gather(收集) flowers and lilies(百合) or perhaps to gaze(凝視) upon a rose(玫瑰花) as they twirl(使快速旋轉) it in the air, or to twine(纏繞) it in their hair; while some board(（上船) ships and even cross the sea to meet different kinds of people; no one worries any longer about the winds or the great downpours(傾盆大雨) of rain from the sky. ‘Whereas I resemble(像) a dictator(獨裁者) or a despot’, said Winter. ‘I command(命令) everyone to look not at the sky but down toward the ground; I frighten(使驚恐) them and make them tremble(顫抖) and sometimes I make them content(知足的) themselves while having to stay indoors(在室內) all day.’ Spring replied, ‘Indeed, that is exactly why mankind(人類) would be glad to get rid of you, whereas(儘管) even the mere(僅僅的) mention(提到) of my name is enough to bring them pleasure(愉快). By Zeus, there is no name more pleasant(親切友好的) than mine! That is why they think fondly(喜愛地) of me when I am gone and give thanks when I appear again.’
