Fable 187

The Lion and the Man Disputing(爭執)

A man and a lion were arguing about who was best, with each one seeking evidence in support of his claim(聲稱). They came to a tombstone(墓碑) on which a man was shown in the act of strangling(扼死) a lion, and the man offered(提供) this picture as evidence(證據). The lion then replied, ‘It was a man who painted this; if a lion had painted it, you would instead see a lion strangling a man. But let’s look at some real evidence instead.’ The lion then brought the man to the amphitheatre and showed him, so he could see with his own eyes, just how a lion strangles a man. The lion then concluded(斷定), ‘A pretty picture is not proof: facts are the only real evidence!’

When the evidence is fairly weighed (仔細考慮), a colourfully painted lie is quickly refuted(否認…的正確性) by the facts.
