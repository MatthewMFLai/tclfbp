Fable 182

Zeus(【希神】宙斯) and Apollo(太陽神阿波羅)

As he made a distant(遙遠的) shot with his bow and arrow, Apollo said to the gods, ‘No one can shoot farther(更遠) than I, not even Zeus.’ Zeus played along and agreed to a contest(比賽). Hermes shook the lots in the helmet of Ares(【希神】愛力士). The lot(籤) fell to Apollo, who went first, flexing(使繃緊) the golden bowstring(弓弦) and swiftly(迅速地) letting loose an arrow which landed inside the Garden of the Hesperides(【希神】海絲佩拉蒂). Zeus then covered the same distance in a single stride(邁大步走) and stood there asking, ‘Where should I shoot my arrow, son? There’s nowhere for me to stand.’ So it was that Zeus won the archery(射箭運動) contest without even taking a shot.

NOTE : Ares was the Greek god of war (Roman Mars). The Hesperides were the daughters of Atlas(【希神】以肩頂天的巨神阿特力士), and together with a dragon they guarded a tree of golden apples in a garden at the western edge of the world.
