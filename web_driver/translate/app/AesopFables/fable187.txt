Fable 187

The Lion and the Man Disputing

A man and a lion were arguing about who was best, with each one seeking evidence in support of his claim. They came to a tombstone on which a man was shown in the act of strangling a lion, and the man offered this picture as evidence. The lion then replied, ‘It was a man who painted this; if a lion had painted it, you would instead see a lion strangling a man. But let’s look at some real evidence instead.’ The lion then brought the man to the amphitheatre and showed him, so he could see with his own eyes, just how a lion strangles a man. The lion then concluded, ‘A pretty picture is not proof: facts are the only real evidence!’

When the evidence is fairly weighed, a colourfully painted lie is quickly refuted by the facts.
