Fable 188

The Fox, the Monkey, and His Ancestors

A fox and a monkey were travelling along the same road. They passed through a cemetery(墓地), and the monkey said to the fox, ‘All these dead people were the freedmen(自由民) of my ancestors.’ The fox then said to the monkey, ‘This is an opportune(合適的) moment for you to tell such lies: not a single one of the people entombed(埋葬) in this place can rise up and refute(駁斥) what you say!’

This fable can be used to indict(告發) charlatans(騙子) and anyone who deals in lies instead of the truth.
