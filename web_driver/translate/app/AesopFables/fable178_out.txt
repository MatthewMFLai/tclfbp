Fable 178

The Bees, the Drones(雄蜂), and the Wasp(黃蜂)

The bees had built their honeycombs(蜂巢) up high in an oak(橡樹) tree but the lazy drones insisted(堅持) that the honeycombs were theirs. The case went to court, with the wasp presiding(主持會議). Given that the judge was well acquainted(相識的) with both the bees and the drones, she made the following proposal(建議) to the two parties: ‘Your bodies are not dissimilar(不同的) and your colouring is the same, which makes this an undeniably(不可否認地) difficult decision. Of course, I want to be absolutely scrupulous(嚴格認真的), avoiding any hasty(輕率的) judgements. So, please take these hives(蜂窩) and fill them full of waxen(蠟製的) cells. The taste of the honey(蜂蜜) and the shape of the combs will reveal(揭露) which party is actually responsible for the honeycombs in question.’ While the drones refused to comply(遵守) with this request(（要求), the proposal greatly pleased the bees. Thereupon(隨即) the judge pronounced(宣佈) the following sentence(判決): ‘It’s clear who was incapable(不會的) of making those honeycombs, and who it was that made them. Accordingly(相應地), I return to the bees the fruit of their labours.’

I would not have included this fable except for the fact that the drones refused the chance to prove their credibility(可信性).

NOTE : Compare the proverbial(俗話所說的) saying that ‘even wasps build combs’ (e.g. Tertullian, Against Marcion 4.5). The difference, of course, is that the wasps’ combs have no honey.
