Fable 197

The Dog, the Sow(母豬), and Aphrodite(【希神】愛芙羅黛蒂（司愛與美之女神）)

A sow and a dog were viciously(敵意地) arguing with one another. The sow, for her part, swore by Aphrodite that she would tear the dog to pieces with her teeth. The dog replied ironically(諷刺地), ‘Yes indeed, you do well to swear(發誓) by Aphrodite! It’s clear just how much she loves you, since she absolutely forbids(禁止) anyone who has tasted your filthy(骯髒的) flesh to enter her temple(神殿).’ The sow retorted(反駁), ‘This is even more evidence of the goddess’s love for me, since she turns away anyone who has slain(殘殺) or mistreated(虐待) me in any way. As for you, you just smell bad, dead or alive!’

This story shows how a discerning(有眼光的) speaker can deftly(靈巧的) turn the insults of his enemies into compliments(讚揚).

NOTE : Aphrodite supposedly(據稱) hated pigs because her lover, Adonis(愛神Arodite所愛的美少年), had been killed by a wild boar(野豬). The Greek proverb(諺語) ‘he sacrificed a pig to Aphrodite’ (Erasmus, Adages 3.1.30) was used to refer to someone who gave an inappropriate(不適當的) or unwanted(不需要的) gift.
