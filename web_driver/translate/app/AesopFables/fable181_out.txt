Fable 181

The Swallow(燕子) and the Snake

Spring had arrived, and a twittering(鳴囀) swallow (that bird who dwells(棲身) in human houses) built her nest in the wall of the place which is home to the elderly(年老的) jurors(陪審員) of the court. In that hall of justice(正義), the mother bird gave birth to seven baby birds. But a snake came creeping(悄然進行的) out from his hole and devoured(吞食) all the chicks one by one. The wretched(苦惱的) mother bewailed(為…而悲傷) the untimely(（不合時宜的) demise(死亡) of her children and said, ‘Woe(我好苦啊！) is me, and woe is my lot(命運) in life! This is the place where mankind’s laws and judgements are made but I, a swallow, am the victim of injustice(不公正) and have to run away.’

NOTE : This fable can also be found in the Greek Anthology 7.210, although(儘管) that versionis not set in a courthouse(法院大樓) (and the story ends with the snake falling into a fire).
