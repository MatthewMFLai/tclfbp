Fable 191

The Leopard(美洲豹) and the Fox(狐狸)

The leopard, renowned(有名的) for his spots and the fine fur(毛皮) of his chest, went out into the fields together with the other animals. As the coats of the mighty lions were all one colour, the leopard quickly concluded(斷定) that the lions must be a wretched(素質差的) species indeed. Scorning(輕視) the rest of the animals for their slovenly(邋遢的) appearance(外表), the leopard considered himself to be the only true example of nobility(貴族) among them. As the leopard was rejoicing(深感欣喜) in the novelty(新穎) of his apparel(服裝), the sly(狡猾的) fox criticized(批評) him sharply and showed how useless his markings were. ‘Go ahead and put your faith in the excessive embellishment(裝飾) of your youth,’ said the fox, ‘so long as my intelligence(智慧) is more attractive than yours: after all, mental endowments(天資) are more impressive than the glamour(魅力) of good looks!’
