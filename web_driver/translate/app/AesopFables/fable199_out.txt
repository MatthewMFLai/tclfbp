Fable 199

The Wasp(黃蜂) and the Butterfly(蝴蝶)

A butterfly noticed a wasp flying by and exclaimed(呼喊), ‘What an unfair(不公平的) turn of events this is! In our previous lifetimes, when we inhabited(居住於) the bodies from whose mortal(凡人) remains we received our souls(靈魂), I was the one who spoke eloquently(雄辯的) in times of peace and fought bravely(勇敢的) in war, and I was first among my fellows(夥伴們) in all of the arts! Yet look at me now, an utter(徹底的) frivolity(輕薄), crumbling(使粉碎) into ashes as I flutter(拍翅) here and there. You, on the other hand, were formerly(在過去) a mule(騾子), a beast of burden(重擔), yet now you stab(刺) and wound(使受傷) anyone you want with your sting.’ The wasp then uttered words that are worth(值得…) repeating: ‘It does not matter what we used to be: the important thing is what we are now!’

NOTE : This fable derives(取得) from the ancient(古老的) belief that wasps would spring from the carcass(屍體) of a dead mule or horse (e.g. Aelian, Characteristics of Animals 1.28), while a spirit or ‘psyche’ would take shape in the form of a butterfly (Aristotle, History of Animals 551 a ).
