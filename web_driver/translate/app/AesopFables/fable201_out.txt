The Trees and the Bramble(刺藤) Bush

The pomegranate(石榴樹) and the apple tree were debating about their beauty. They had both gone on at great length arguing back and forth when a bramble bush in a nearby(附近的) hedge heard them and said, ‘Dear friends, let us put a stop to our quarrel(爭吵).’ The fable shows that when there is a dispute(爭端) among sophisticated(老於世故的) people, then riff-raff(不三不四的人) also try to act important.

NOTE :For a similar story about a crab(蟹) who gets involved in a dispute between dolphins and whales, see Fable 220. Other versions of this fable include the olive tree amongst(在……中間) the disputants(爭議人).
