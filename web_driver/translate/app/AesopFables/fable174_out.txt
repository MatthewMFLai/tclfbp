Fable 174

The Sheep, the Dog, and the Wolf

Wicked(邪惡的) liars(騙子) generally get their just deserts(獲得應得之物).

A dog made false accusations(指控) against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly(根據推測) borrowed(借) from him. The dog summoned(傳喚) the wolf as his witness(（證人) and the wolf testified(作證) that the sheep didn’t owe(欠) the dog just one loaf(一條) of bread: he swore that she owed him ten! Based on this false evidence, the sheep was found guilty(犯了罪的) and was sentenced(宣判) to pay what she did not owe. A few days later the sheep found the same wolf lying dead in a ditch(溝渠). ‘This,’ said the sheep, ‘is the reward(報償) that the gods give to liars.’
