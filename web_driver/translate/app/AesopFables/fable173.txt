Fable 173

The Man Bitten by the Dog

A man who had just been badly bitten by a dog was looking for someone who could heal his wound. He ran into someone who told him, ‘Here is what you need to do: let the blood from your wound drip onto a piece of bread and then feed the bread to the dog who bit you. If you do that, your wound will be cured.’ The man who had been bitten by the dog replied, ‘But if I do that, every single dog in the city will want to bite me!’

This fable shows that if someone respects and honours a wicked man, the wicked man will not return the favour, since his only friends are other wicked men like himself.

NOTE : In another version of this fable (Phaedrus 2.3), the man actually gives the blood-soaked bread to the dog who bit him, provoking Aesop to remark that if the othe dogs find out, they will all want to bite him
