Fable 165
The Lion and the Two Men

A lion was standing over a young bull(公牛) whom he had killed when a robber(搶劫者) showed up and demanded(強烈要求) a part of the spoils(掠奪物). ‘I would agree,’ the lion said, ‘if you were not already in the habit(壞習慣) of taking whatever you want!’ Thus, the lion refused the villain’s request. Meanwhile（與此同時), an innocent(無惡意的) wayfarer(徒步旅行者) also happened upon the very same spot, although he backed away as soon as he saw the ferocious(兇猛的) lion. ‘There is nothing to be afraid of,’ the lion said to him in kindly tones(口吻). ‘Please, take without hesitation(猶豫) the portion(一份) of this prize that your modesty(謙遜) has earned for you.’ He then divided the bull into pieces and went away into the woods, so that the man would come forward freely.

This is an altogether(全然) outstanding(優秀的) and admirable(可欽佩的) model of behaviour(行為); in the real world, however, greed(貪婪) grows wealthy(富有的) while honesty(誠實) goes unrewarded(未獲得報償的).
