Fable 177

The Roosters(雄雞) and the Hawk(鷹)

There was a rooster who was always quarrelling(爭吵) with another rooster, so he asked the hawk to judge(判斷) their dispute(糾紛). The rooster was actually hoping that when he brought the other rooster before the judge(裁判員), the judge would devour(吞食) him. Yet when they came before the judge to make their arguments, the hawk grabbed(抓取) the rooster who had originally brought the case to court. The rooster shouted, ‘Not me! You want the one who is running away!’ The hawk replied, ‘Abandon all hope of being released(釋放) from my talons(爪) today! Justice(正義法) demands that you yourself should suffer the punishment(懲罰) that you intended(預謀的) for another.’

For people who plot(密謀) the demise(死亡) of others, not realizing what might happen to them as a result.
