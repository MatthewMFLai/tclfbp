The Trees and the Bramble Bush

The pomegranate and the apple tree were debating about their beauty. They had both gone on at great length arguing back and forth when a bramble bush in a nearby hedge heard them and said, ‘Dear friends, let us put a stop to our quarrel.’ The fable shows that when there is a dispute among sophisticated people, then riff-raff also try to act important.

NOTE :For a similar story about a crab who gets involved in a dispute between dolphins and whales, see Fable 220. Other versions of this fable include the olive tree amongst the disputants.
