Fable 172

Apollo(太陽神) and the Snake

A creeping(悄然進行的) snake who had been stepped on by many people made his way to the temple(神殿) of Apollo and went inside. Apollo immediately explained to the snake, ‘If you had simply killed the first person who stepped on you, no one would ever have dared(膽敢) to step on you again!’

The story shows that if people who have previously(先前地) committed(犯罪) a crime are swiftly(迅速地) punished(懲罰), then others will become afraid on their account(根據).
