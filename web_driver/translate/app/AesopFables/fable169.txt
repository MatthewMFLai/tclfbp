Fable 169

The Wolf and the Lion

A wolf had seized a young pig and was carrying it away when he ran into a lion. The lion immediately took the pig away from him. After having to surrender the pig, the wolf said to himself, ‘I wondered myself how what I acquired by theft could possibly have stayed with me.’

The fable shows that if someone acquires other people’s property by fraud or force, he cannot expect to keep it.
