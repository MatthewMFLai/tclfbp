Fable 169

The Wolf(狼) and the Lion

A wolf had seized(抓住) a young pig and was carrying it away when he ran into a lion. The lion immediately(直接地) took the pig away from him. After having to surrender(被迫交出) the pig, the wolf said to himself, ‘I wondered myself how what I acquired(取得) by theft(偷竊) could possibly have stayed with me.’

The fable shows that if someone acquires other people’s property by fraud(詐騙) or force, he cannot expect to keep it.
