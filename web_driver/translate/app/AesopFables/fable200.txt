Fable 200

The Fir Tree and the Bramble Bush

The fir tree and the bramble bush were quarrelling with one another. The fir tree sang her own praises at length. ‘I am beautiful and attractively tall. I grow straight up, a neighbour to the clouds. I supply the hall’s roof and the ship’s keel. How can you compare yourself, you mere thorn, to such a tree as myself?’ The bramble bush then said to the tree, ‘Just remember the axes which are always chopping away at you! Then even you can understand that it is better to be a bramble bush.’

A famous man has more glory than lesser people, but he is also exposed to greater dangers.
