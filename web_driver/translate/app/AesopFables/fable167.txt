Fable 167

The Murderer and the Mulberry Tree

A robber had murdered someone along the road. When the bystanders began to chase him, he dropped the bloody corpse and ran away. Some travellers coming from the opposite direction asked the man how he had stained his hands. The man said that he had just climbed down from a mulberry tree, but as he was speaking, his pursuers caught up with him. They seized the murderer and crucified him on a mulberry tree. The tree said to him, ‘It does not trouble me at all to assist in your execution, since you tried to smear me with the murder that you yourself committed!’

It often happens that even honest people do not hesitate to persecute someone who has slandered them.
