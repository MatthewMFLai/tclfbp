Fable 190

The Saltwater(鹽水的) Fish and the Freshwater(淡水的) Fish

Carried from his freshwater pond by a rushing stream, a freshwater fish rushed headlong(頭向前地) into the waters of the sea. The shameless(不要臉的) creature scorned(鄙視) the scaly schools in the sea and boasted(自吹自擂) endlessly(無窮地) of his own illustrious(卓越的) origins. A saltwater fish could not suffer this refugee(難民) in his own ancestral waters and he spoke these pungent(尖刻的) words, naturally salted with wit(幽默風趣): ‘Enough of your empty lies and pretentious(做作的) talk; you yourself are the best evidence of their absurdity(荒誕). If the two of us are captured(俘虜) and hauled(拉) in by the same dripping(濕透的) net, I will be able to prove to you just who is more highly regarded(看待) by the crowd of onlookers(旁觀者): you will see that I am bought by the connoisseur(食品鑒賞家) at a very high price indeed, while you will be sold to an undiscriminating(無鑑別力的) commoner(平民) for a mere penny or two!’

NOTE : Avianus simply refers to the freshwater fish as piscis(南魚座), fish. As for the saltwater fish, phukis, it is not entirely clear what species he had in mind: Greek sources suggest it is some kind of wrasse(隆頭魚科的魚), although Pliny (Natural History 9.26) seems to think it is a lamprey(七鰓鰻).
