Fable 194

The Dove and the Crow

A dove who lived in a certain dovecote was boasting about the number of children she had given birth to. The crow heard her and said, ‘Stop your bragging! The more children you have, the greater the slavery you bring into the world!’

The fable shows that the most unfortunate house slaves are the ones who give birth to children in captivity.
