Fable 174

The Sheep, the Dog, and the Wolf

Wicked liars generally get their just deserts.

A dog made false accusations against the sheep, demanding that she pay him back a loaf of bread which, he insisted, the sheep had supposedly borrowed from him. The dog summoned the wolf as his witness and the wolf testified that the sheep didn’t owe the dog just one loaf of bread: he swore that she owed him ten! Based on this false evidence, the sheep was found guilty and was sentenced to pay what she did not owe. A few days later the sheep found the same wolf lying dead in a ditch. ‘This,’ said the sheep, ‘is the reward that the gods give to liars.’
