Fable 171

Hermes, the Man, and the Ants

There was once a ship that sank with all hands on board. A man who saw what had happened said that the gods’ judgement was unfair: because of just one sinner who was on board the ship, many men had died together with him, even though they were innocent. While the man was speaking, a swarm of ants started crawling over him as they rushed in their usual frenzy to feed on some bits of wheat chaff. When one of the ants bit the man, he proceeded to trample a considerable number of them underfoot. Hermes then appeared and struck the man with his wand as he said, ‘So, are you going to let the gods pass judgement on you humans just as you have passed judgement on the ants?’

NOTE : The god Hermes carried a special wand in his role as a messenger and herald of the gods, in addition to his famous winged sandals.
