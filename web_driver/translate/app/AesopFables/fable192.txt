Fable 192

The Raven, the Swallow, and the Seasons

The swallow and the raven were quarrelling with each other about who was more beautiful. The raven said to the swallow, ‘Your beauty is seen only in the springtime, and when winter comes it cannot hold out against the cold. My physique, on the other hand, holds up admirably both during the cold of winter and the summer heat.’

This fable shows that the strength and well-being of the body are superior to physical beauty or the charms of youth.
