Fable 190

The Saltwater Fish and the Freshwater Fish

Carried from his freshwater pond by a rushing stream, a freshwater fish rushed headlong into the waters of the sea. The shameless creature scorned the scaly schools in the sea and boasted endlessly of his own illustrious origins. A saltwater fish could not suffer this refugee in his own ancestral waters and he spoke these pungent words, naturally salted with wit: ‘Enough of your empty lies and pretentious talk; you yourself are the best evidence of their absurdity. If the two of us are captured and hauled in by the same dripping net, I will be able to prove to you just who is more highly regarded by the crowd of onlookers: you will see that I am bought by the connoisseur at a very high price indeed, while you will be sold to an undiscriminating commoner for a mere penny or two!’

NOTE : Avianus simply refers to the freshwater fish as piscis, fish. As for the saltwater fish, phukis, it is not entirely clear what species he had in mind: Greek sources suggest it is some kind of wrasse, although Pliny (Natural History 9.26) seems to think it is a lamprey.
