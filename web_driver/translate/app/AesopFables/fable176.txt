Fable 176

The Sheep, the Stag, and the Wolf

When a liar has dishonest backers, he is not trying to make a deal: he wants to play a dirty trick.

A stag asked the sheep to loan him a peck of wheat, with the wolf vouching for his good credit. The sheep, however, saw that there was trouble ahead, so she said, ‘The wolf always just takes what he wants and vanishes, while you are the sort who turns tail and runs. How can I hope to find either of you when it comes time to collect?’
