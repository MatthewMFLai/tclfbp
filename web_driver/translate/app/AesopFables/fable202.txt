Fable 202

The Oak Tree and the Reed

A story about a reed and an oak, urging us not to rely on strength. A reed got into an argument with an oak tree. The oak tree marvelled at her own strength, boasting that she could stand her own in a battle against the winds. Meanwhile, she condemned the reed for being weak, since he was naturally inclined to yield to every breeze. The wind then began to blow very fiercely. The oak tree was torn up by her roots and toppled over, while the reed was left bent but unharmed.

Those who adapt to the times will emerge unscathed.
