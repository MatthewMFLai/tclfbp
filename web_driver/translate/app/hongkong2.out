"Is more better now, Master?"

I grunted(發出呼嚕聲) luxuriously(舒適的) and the velvet(柔軟光滑的) hands withdrew from my shoulders. More Tiger Balm was applied to the finger tips and then the hands were back, now to massage(按摩) the base of my neck with soft authority. Through the open french windows the song of bulbuls(鵯科鳴鳥) came from the big orchid(蘭花) tree covered with deep pink blossom and two Chinese magpies(喜鵲) chattered(吱吱叫) in the grove of casuarina(木麻黃樹). Somewhere far away turtle doves were saying 'coocoroo'. Number One Boy (Number One from among seven in the house) came in to say that breakfast was ready on the veranda. I exchanged compliments with the dimpling masseuse(女按摩師), put on a shirt and trousers and sandals and walked out into the spectacular, sun-drenched view.

As, half-way through the delicious(美味的) scrambled eggs and bacon, a confiding(易信任別人的) butterfly, black and cream and dark blue, settled on my wrist, I reflected that heaven could wait. Here, on the green and scarcely(幾乎不) inhabited(居住於) slopes of Shek-O, above Big Wave Bay on the south-east corner of Hong Kong island, was good enough.

This was my first morning in Hong Kong and this small paradise(天堂) was the house of friends, Mr and Mrs Hugh Barton. Hugh Barton is perhaps the most powerful surviving English taipan(大班) (big shot) in the Orient, and he lives in discreet(謹慎的) accordance(依照規則) with his status as Chairman of Messrs Jardine Matheson, the great Far Eastern trading corporation(大公司) founded by two energetic(精力旺盛的) Scotsmen one hundred and forty years ago. They say in Hong Kong that power resides in the Jockey Club, Jardine Mathesons, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, and Her Majesty's Government—in that order. Hugh Barton, being a steward(財產管理人) of the Jockey Club, Chairman of Jardine's, Deputy(副手) Chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank and a member of the Governor's Legislative Council, has it every way, and when I complained of a mildly stiff(硬的) neck after my flight it was natural that so powerful a taipan's household should conjure(用魔法變出) up a comely(秀麗的) masseuse before breakfast. That is the right way, but alas how rare, for powerful taipans to operate. When, the night before, I had complimented(恭維) Mrs Barton for having fixed a supremely(至上地) theatrical new moon for my arrival, I was not being all that fanciful(空想的).

Apart from being the last stronghold(要塞) of feudal(封建的) luxury in the world, Hong Kong is the most vivid(生動的) and exciting city I have ever seen, and I recommend it without reserve to anyone who possesses the fare. It seems to have everything—modern comfort in a theatrically Oriental setting; an equable(穩定的) climate except during the monsoons; beautiful country for walking or riding; all sports, including the finest golf course—the Royal Hong Kong—in the East, the most expensively equipped racecourse, and wonderful skin-diving; exciting flora(植物群) and fauna(動物群), including the celebrated butterflies of Hong Kong; and a cost of living that compares favourably with any other tourist city. Minor attractions include really good Western and Chinese restaurants, exotic night life, cigarettes at 1s. 3d. for twenty, and heavy Shantung silk suits, shirts, etc., expertly tailored in forty-eight hours.

With these and innumerable(數不清的) other advantages it is, therefore, not surprising that the population of this minute territory is over three million, or one million more than the whole of New Zealand. The fact that six hundred and fifty million communist Chinese are a few miles away across the frontier seems only to add zest(狂熱) to the excitement at all levels of life in the colony and, from the Governor down, if there is an underlying tension, there is certainly no dismay(沮喪). Obviously China could take Hong Kong by a snap of its giant fingers, but China has shown no signs of wishing to do so, and when the remaining forty years of our lease of the mainland territory expire, I see no reason why a reduced population should not retreat to the islands and the original territory which we hold in perpetuity(永存).

Whatever the future holds, there is no sign that a sinister(陰險的), doom-fraught count-down is in progress. It is true that the colony every now and then gets the shivers, but when an American bank pulled up stumps during the Quemoy troubles in 1958, there was nothing but mockery(嘲笑). The government pressed on inside the leased territory with the building of the largest hospital in the Orient and with the erection of an average of two schools a month to meet the influx(湧進) of refugees from China. The private Chinese and European builders also pressed on, and continue to press on today, with the construction of twenty-storey apartment houses for the lower and middle classes. Altogether it is a gay(愉快的) and splendid colony humming with vitality(生命力) and progress, and pure joy to the senses and spirits.

Apart from my host, my guide, philosopher and friend in Hong Kong, and later in Japan, was 'Our Man in the Orient', Richard Hughes, Far Eastern correspondent(記者) of the Sunday Times. He is a giant Australian with a European mind and a quixotic(狂想的) view of the world exemplified(作為……的例子) by his founding of the Baritsu branch of the Baker Street Irregulars—Baritsu is Japanese for the national code of self-defence which includes judo(柔道), and is the only Japanese word known to have been used by Sherlock Holmes.

On my first evening he and I went out on the town.

The streets of Hong Kong are the most enchanting(迷人的) night streets I have trod(步行). Here the advertising agencies are ignorant of the drab(乏味的) fact, knows all too well in London and New York, that patterns of black and red and yellow have the most compelling(很有說服力的) impact(衝擊) on the human eye. Avoiding(避開) harsh(粗糙的) primary colours, the streets of Hong Kong are evidence that neon lighting need not be hideous, and the crowded Chinese ideograms(表意文字) in pale violet and pink and green with a plentiful(充足的) use of white are entrancing(使…著迷) not only for their colours but also because one does not know what drab messages and exhortations(規勸) they spell out. The smell of the streets is sea-clean with an occasional exciting dash of sandalwood(檀香) from a joss-stick factory, frying onions, and the scent of sweet perspiration that underlies Chinese cooking. The girls, thanks to the cheong sams they wear, have a deft(靈巧的) and coltish(不受拘束的) prettiness which sends Western women into paroxysms(爆發) of envy(忌妒). The high, rather stiff collar of the cheong sam gives authority and poise(泰然自若) to the head and shoulders, and the flirtatious(賣俏的) slits from the hem(褶邊) of the dress upwards, as high as the beauty of the leg will allow, demonstrate that the sex appeal of the inside of a woman's knee has apparently never occurred to Dior or Balmain. No doubt there are fat or dumpy Chinese women in Hong Kong, but I never saw one. Even the men, in their spotless white shirts and dark trousers, seem to have better, fitter figures than we in the West, and the children are a constant enchantment(魅力).

We started off our evening at the solidest bar in Hong Kong—the sort of place that Hemingway liked to write about, lined with ships' badges and other trophies(獎盃), with, over the bar, a stuffed(填製的) alligator(短吻鱷) with an iguana(鬣蜥蜴) riding on its back. The bar belongs to Jack Conder, a former Shanghai municipal(市立的) policeman and reputed(馳名的) to have been the best pistol(手槍) shot there in the old days. His huge fists seem to hold the memory of many a recalcitrant(桀驁不馴的) chin. He will not allow women in the bar downstairs on the grounds that real men should be allowed to drink alone. When the Japanese came in 1941, Conder stayed on in Shanghai, was captured and escaped. He took the long walk all the way down China to Chungking, sleeping during daylight hours in graveyards(墓地), where the ghosts effectively protected him. He is the authentic(真正的) Hemingway type and he sells solid drinks at reasonable prices. His bar is the meeting place of 'Alcoholics Synonymous'—a group of lesser Hemingway characters, most of them local press correspondents(記者). The initiation ceremony requires the consumption of sixteen San Migs, which is the pro name for the local San Miguel beer—to my taste a very unencouraging brew.

After fortification(設防) with Western poisons (I gather that no self-respecting Chinese would think of drinking before dinner, but that the fashion for whisky is invading the Orient almost as fast as it has invaded France) we proceeded to one of the finest Chinese locales(場所), the Peking Restaurant. Dick Hughes, a hard-bitten Orientalogue, was determined that I should become Easternized as soon as possible and he missed no opportunity to achieve(完成) the conversion. The Peking Restaurant was bright and clean. We consumed seriatim(順次):

Shark's fin soup with crab,
shrimp balls in oil,
bamboo shoots with seaweed,
chicken and walnuts,
with, as a main dish,

roast Peking duckling,
washed down with mulled(加糖和香料等) wine. Lotus seeds in syrup added a final gracious(親切的) touch.

Dick insisted that then, and on all future occasions when we were together, I should eat with chopsticks, and I pecked(啄) around with these graceful but ridiculous(荒唐的) instruments with clumsy enthusiasm(熱情). To my surprise the meal, most elegantly(高雅地) presented and served, was in every respect delicious. All the tastes were new and elusive(難以描述), but I was particularly struck with another aspect of Oriental cuisine—each dish had a quality of gaiety(愉快) about it, assisted by discreet ornamentation(裝飾), so that the basically unattractive process of shovelling(鏟) food into one's mouth achieved, whether one liked it or not, a kind of elegance. And the background to this, and to all my subsequent(隨後的) meals in the East, always had this quality of gaiety—people chattering(喋喋不休) happily and smiling with pleasure and encouragement. From now on, all the meals I ate in authentic, as opposed to tourist, Chinese or Japanese restaurants were infinitely removed from what, for a lifetime, had been a dull, rather unattractive routine in the sombre(嚴肅的) eating-mills of the West, where the customer, his neighbours and the waiters seem subtly(微妙地) to resent(不滿) each other, the fact that they should all be there together, and very often the things they are eating.

Dick Hughes spiced(加香料的) our banquet(盛宴) with the underground(地下的) and underworld(黑社會) gossip of the colony—the inability(無能) of the government to deal drastically(大大地；徹底地) with Hong Kong's only real problem, the water shortage. Why didn't they hand it over to private enterprise? The gas and electricity services were splendidly run by the Kadoorie brothers, whose record had been equally honourable in Shanghai. There was a grave shortage of hotels. Why didn't Jardines do something about it? Japanese mistresses(情婦) were preferable(較合適的) to Chinese girls. If, for one reason or another, you fell out with your Japanese girl, she would be dignified(有尊嚴的), philosophical. But the Chinese girl would throw endless hysterical(歇斯底里的) scenes, and probably turn up at your office and complain to your employer. Servants? They were plentiful and wonderful, but too many of the English and American wives had no idea how to treat good servants. They would clap their hands and shout 'Boy!' to cover their lack of self-confidence. This sort of behaviour was out of fashion and brought the Westerner into disrepute(不名譽). (How often one has heard the same thing said of English wives in other 'coloured' countries!)

The latest public scandal(醜聞) was the massage parlours(起居室) and the blue cinemas (with colour and sound!) that flourished(蓬勃發展), particularly across the harbour in Kowloon. The Hong Kong Standard had been trying to clean them up. The details they had published had anyway been good for circulation(流傳). He read out from the Standard: 'Erotic(色情) dailies circulate(流傳) freely here. Blue films shown openly. Hong Kong police round up massage girls.' The Standard had given the names and addresses: 'Miss Ten Thousand Fun and Safety at 23 Stanley Street, 2nd floor. Business starting at 9 a.m.... Miss Soft and Warm Village ... Miss Outer Space, and Miss Lotus of Love at 17 Café Apartments, Room 113, ground floor. (Opposite the French Hospital. Room heated) ... Miss Chaste and Refined, Flat A, Percival Mansion, 6th floor (lift service).' And more wonderful names: 'Miss Smooth and Fragrant ... Miss Emerald(翡翠) Parsley ... Miss Peach Stream Pool (satisfaction guaranteed),' and so forth.

The trouble, explained Dick, was partly the traditional(傳統的) desire of Oriental womanhood to please, combined with unemployment and the rising cost of living. Increase in the number of light industries, particularly the textile(紡織品) mills, the bane(剋星，禍根[the) of Lancashire and America, might help. Would I like to visit the latest textile mill? I said I wouldn't.

It was a natural step from this conversation to proceed from the Peking Restaurant(飯店) to the world of Suzie Wong.

Richard Mason, with his splendid book The World of Suzie Wong, has done for a modest waterfront(灘) hotel what Hemingway did for his very different Harry's Bar in Venice. The book, though, like A Many-Splendoured Thing by Han Suyin, read universally by the literate(有文化修養的) in Hong Kong, is small-mindedly frowned upon, largely I gather because miscegenation(雜婚) with beautiful Chinese girls is understandably an unpopular(不受歡迎的) topic with the great union of British womanhood. But the Suzie Wong myth(神話) is in Hong Kong to stay, and Richard Mason would be amused(感到好笑的) to find how it has gathered depth(深度) and detail.

It seems to be fact, for instance, and perhaps the only known fact, that when he was in Hong Kong Richard Mason did live in a waterfront establishment called the Luk Kwok Hotel, transformed in his book into the Nam Kok House of Pleasure, where the painter, Robert Lomax, befriended(對某人友好) and, after comic(滑稽的), tender, romantic and finally tragic(悲慘的) interludes(插曲), married the charming prostitute(娼妓) Suzie Wong.

As a result of the book, the Luk Kwok Hotel, so conveniently(方便的) placed near the Fleet landing stage and the British Sailors' Home, has boomed(迅速發展). Solitary(單獨的) girls may still not sit unaccompanied(無伴侶的) in the spacious bar with its great and many-splendoured juke-box. You must still bring them in from outside, as did Lomax, to prevent the hotel becoming, legally, a disorderly(無秩序的) house. But the whole place has been redecorated(重新裝飾) in deep battleship grey (to remind the sailors of home?) and one of Messrs Collins's posters advertising Richard Mason's book has a place of honour on the main wall. Other signs of prosperity(昌盛) are a huge and hideous(極醜的) near-Braque on another wall, a smart Anglepoise(曲臂檯燈) light over the cash register, and a large bowl of Siamese fighting fish. (It is also a sign of fame(名氣), of which the proprietor(老闆) is very proud, that the totally respectable Prime Minister of Laos and his Foreign Minister stayed at the Luk Kwok on a visit to Hong Kong.)

If you inquire(打聽) after Suzie herself, you are answered with a melancholy(憂鬱) shake of the head and the sad, dramatic(戲劇性的) news that Suzie's marriage(婚姻) failed and she is now back 'on the pipe'. When you ask where you could find her, it is explained that she will see no other man and waits for Lomax one day to return. She is not in too bad a way, as Lomax sends her regular remittances(匯款) from London. But there are many other beautiful girls here just as beautiful as Suzie. Would you care to meet one, a very particular friend of Suzie's?

I don't know how much the sailors believe this story, but I suspect(猜想) they are all quite happy to put up with 'Suzie's friend', and I for one greatly enjoyed exploring the myth that will for ever inhabit(居住於) the Luk Kwok Hotel with its neon(霓虹燈) slogans(口號): 'GIRLS, BUT NO OBLIGATION(義務) TO BUY DRINKS! CLEAN SURROUNDINGS! ENJOY TO THE MAXIMUM AT THE LEAST EXPENSE(花錢)!'

Dick Hughes misunderstood(誤解) one author's delighted interest in the brilliance(光輝) of another author's myth, and protested(抗議) that there were far better establishments(機構) awaiting(等待) my patronage(資助). But by now it was late and the after-effects of jet travel—a dull headache and a bronchial(支氣管的) breathlessness—had caught up with me, and we ended our evening with a walk along the thronged(群眾) quays(碼頭) in search of a taxi and home.

On the way I commented(評語) on the fact that there is not a single seagull(海鷗) in the whole vast(廣大的) expanse(廣闊區域) of Hong Kong harbour. Dick waved towards the dense flood of junks and sampans(舢板) on which families of up to half a dozen spend the whole of their lives, mostly tied up in harbour. There hadn't used to be any seagulls in Shanghai either, he said. Since the communists took over they have come back. The communists have put it about that they had come back because they no longer have to fight with the humans for the harbour refuse(（垃圾). It was probably the same thing in Hong Kong. It would taken an awful(糟糕的) lot of seagulls to compete(競爭) for a living with three million Chinese.

On this downbeat note I closed my first enchanted(陶醉的) day.

*** 
INCIDENTAL(附帶的) INTELLIGENCE

Hotels

By tradition and probably correctly, the Peninsula (the 'Pen'), on the Kowloon peninsula, is regarded as the Number 1 hotel for visitors to the colony. It now has an annexe(附加), Peninsula Court. Rates are from HK$70 (single) to HK$100 (double). Very colonial(殖民地的), comfortable(舒適的), proper. It is generally booked fully for months in advance(預先的). Next come the Miramar (behind the Peninsula geographically, but livelier(生氣勃勃的) and overtaking(超過) it by enterprise and expansion) and the Gloucester (on the island). Miramar rates range from HK$36 to 75; the Gloucester, HK$40 to 75.

If you are holidaying, the Repulse Bay Hotel, across the island and fronting a reasonable(合情理的) beach, is recommended(推薦). (HK$30 to 95.) This is set in lovely gardens and the local beauties, wives and concubines(妾) offer a dazzling(使眼花) display at the Sunday afternoon tea-dances. The food is better than at the Peninsula or the Miramar. But it takes half an hour to cross the island to the business, shopping and social centre of Hong Kong (officially called Victoria).

The Luk Kwok, Suzie Wong's original official address, encourages a livelier clientele(顧客). Single room (an interesting aspiration), HK$11; double (virtually de rigueur), up to HK$35.

(For comparison, a Chinese can get a bed of a sort in a wooden hut or 'garage', shared with half a dozen companions, in the industrial areas for HK$8 (10s.) a month.)



Eating

For Western food, the Marco Polo in the Peninsula Court is the most expensive(昂貴的) restaurant and can sometimes be the best. Gaddi's, off the Peninsula ground-floor marble lobby, is also recommended. On the island, the Parisian Grill (the 'P.G.') is the oldest and best-known restaurant, jam-packed at lunch; but standards and prices at Jimmy's Kitchen and the Gloucester (now operating a rejuvenated(恢復活力) kitchen) are roughly(大致地) equivalent(相同的). Maxim's and the Café de Paris charge slightly more. More Chinese go to Maxim's than to the 'P.G.', and there is dancing in the evening; Hong Kong's feminine(女性的) elegance(優雅) glitters(閃爍) at Maxim's at the cocktail hour. You can get bear's paw—overrated—at the Gloucester. (N.B. The best and biggest martinis(馬丁尼) in the colony are served in the Mexican bar in the Gloucester.)

All visitors want to eat on the floating(浮動的) restaurants at Aberdeen. As this venture(冒險) involves a forty-minute taxi haul from Victoria, the earnest(認真的) diner might care to break his journey at the Repulse Bay Hotel and brace himself with a few shots on the veranda(陽台) around sunset before tackling(處理) the next fifteen-minute stage to reach the floating restaurants at twilight.

Dinner at the Carlton, four miles out of Kowloon on the main road to the New Territories, unfolds(呈現) one of the world's most memorable(難忘的) panoramas: the jewelled lights of Kowloon, the harbour and the island.



Chinese food

The range and quality of Chinese cuisine(菜餚) in Hong Kong are matched(相配的) only in Taipeh. Beggar(乞丐)'s chicken at the Tien Hong Lau in Kowloon is incomparable(無雙的); if possible, it should be ordered the day before. Peking duck is the speciality of the Princess Garden in Kowloon and the Peking Restaurant on the island. The Ivy (on the island) serves exotic(異國風情的) Szechuanese-style food. The Café de Chine serves Cantonese-style dishes in two huge connecting dining-rooms on the top floor of a ten-storey building in the heart of Victoria. A regular wealthy Chinese visitor from San Francisco always goes to the Tai Tung for one special dish which he claims is unequalled(無與倫比的) anywhere else: roast sucking pig à la Cantonese. Everyone has his favourite. You can feast(宴會) cheaply at the lot.



Night Life

Generally, night life in Hong Kong is much as anywhere else. There are twenty-five registered(已註冊的) night-clubs, some of which tolerate second-rate floor shows on the dreary(枯燥的) Asian circuit (Singapore—Kuala Lumpur—Bangkok—Hong Kong—Manila—Tokyo). None are in the same class as the Tokyo night-clubs, and chauvinistic(盲目愛國的) Hong Kong apologists(辯護士), with desperate(鋌而走險的) parochialism(鄉土觀念), are compelled(不得不) to find compensation(彌補) in the proud boast that the local night-clubs don't close until two a.m., while the lights go out reluctantly(不情願的) in the Tokyo cabarets(夜總會) (but not the bars) at midnight.

The dance-hostesses are on call—which does not mean by telephone, but by personal arrangement—at seventy-six 'ballrooms'. The prettiest girls and the best bands tend to be in places like the Tonnochy Ballroom and the Golden Phoenix (on the island) and at the Oriental (in Kowloon), where most of the patrons(老顧客) are Chinese and no hard liquor(酒) is served, only tea, soft drinks and melon seeds.

There are 8,000 registered hostesses, whose company (financed by a coupon system) ranges from 60 cents to HK$5.50 per twenty minutes. At the Tonnochy or the Metropole (where you should ask to study the telephone-directory-like album, which shows the photographs and names of available(可取得聯繫的) hostesses), an hour's dancing will thus cost HK$16.50 (just over £1). Most of the girls in the higher-priced ballrooms are glamorous(有魅力的) and English-speaking and, subject to financial adjustment with the proprietor, will gladly leave the ballroom and accompany(陪同) a visitor to a night-club; this invitation, of course, gives them great face. The tourist has the patriotic(愛國的) satisfaction of knowing that the colony's government collects ten per cent tax on every dance-girl's coupons.

There are scores of brash and noisy bars along Lockhart Street and in Wanchai and North Point (on the island) and throughout(在各處) the back lanes of Kowloon, some of which, when the navies are in port, are a dim echo(仿效) of Shanghai's old Blood Alley.

Although not featured in the prim(古板的) official tourist handbooks, small sampans at Causeway Bay (on the island) offer a mild variation of the old Shanghai and Canton flower-boat entertainment(款待) as once available in the dear dead days before the coming of Mao Tse-Tung. A curtain gives the passengers privacy(隱私權) from the pilot, and the sampan either drifts(漂流) with wind and current in seclusion(隔絕), or moves, as desired, to floating markets and teashops and rafts of singers and musicians. (Tariff: about HK$1 an hour or up to HK$10 for the night.)
