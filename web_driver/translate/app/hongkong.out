f you write thrillers(探險小說), people think that you must live a thrilling life and enjoy doing thrilling things. Starting with these false assumptions(假定), the Editorial Board of the Sunday Times repeatedly urged(敦促) me to do something exciting and write about it and, at the end of October 1959, they came up with the idea that I should make a round trip of the most exciting cities of the world and describe them in beautiful, beautiful prose(散文). This could be accomplished, they said, within a month.

Dubiously(不確定的) I discussed this project with Mr Leonard Russell, Features and Literary Editor of the paper. I said it was going to be very expensive and very exhausting(使人疲憊不堪的), and that one couldn't go round the world in thirty days and report either beautifully or accurately on great cities in approximately(近乎) three days per city. I also said that I was the world's worst sightseer(觀光者) and that I had often advocated(提倡) the provision of roller-skates at the doors of museums and art galleries. I was also, I said, impatient(無耐心的) of lunching at Government Houses and of visiting clinics and resettlement areas.

Leonard Russell was adamant(堅決的). 'We don't want that sort of thing,' he said. 'In your James Bond books, even if people can't put up with James Bond and those fancy heroines(女英雄) of yours, they seem to like the exotic backgrounds. Surely you want to pick up some more material for your stories? This is a wonderful opportunity(時機).'

I objected that my stories were fiction and the sort of things that happened to James Bond didn't happen in real life.

'Rot,' he said firmly.

So, wishing privately to see the world, however rapidly(快的), while it was still there to see, I purchased a round-the-world air ticket for £803 19s. 2d., drew £500 in travellers' cheques from the Chief Accountant and had several 'shots' which made me feel sore and rather dizzy. Then, on November 2nd, armed with a sheaf(捆) of visas, a round-the-world suit with concealed(隱蔽) money pockets, one suitcase in which, as one always does, I packed more than I needed, and my typewriter(打字機), I left humdrum London for the thrilling cities of the world—Hong Kong, Macao, Tokyo, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, New York.

On that soft, grey morning, Comet G/ADOK shot up so abruptly(突然的) from the north-south runway of London Airport that the beige(米色) curtains concealing the lavatories(洗手間) and the cockpit(駕駛員座艙) swayed back into the cabin at an angle of fifteen degrees. The first soaring leap through the overcast was to ten thousand feet. There was a slight tremor(顫抖) as we went through the lower cloud base and another as we came out into the brilliant(光明的) sunshine.

We climbed on another twenty thousand feet into that world above the cotton-wool cloud carpet where it is always a beautiful day. The mind adjusted itself to the prospect of twenty-four hours of this sort of thing—the hot face and rather chilly feet, eyes that smart with the outside brilliance, the smell of Elizabeth Arden and Yardley cosmetics(化妝品) that B.O.A.C. provide for their passengers, the varying whine(刺耳的尖聲) of the jets, the first cigarette of an endless chain of smoke, and the first conversational gambits(開始的行動) exchanged with the seat-fellow who, in this instance, was a pleasant New Zealander with a flow of aboriginal(土著的) jokes and nothing else to do but talk the whole way to Hong Kong.

Zürich came and the banal(平庸的) beauty of Switzerland, then the jagged(鋸齒狀的) sugar-icing of the Alps, the blue puddles(洼) of the Italian lakes and the snow melting down towards the baked terrazza of the Italian plains. My companion commented that we had a good seat 'viewwise', not like the other day when he was crossing the Atlantic and an American woman came aboard and complained when she found herself sitting over the wing. 'It's always the same,' she had cried. 'When I get on an aircraft all I can see outside is wing.' The American next to her had said, 'Listen, Ma'am, you go right on seeing that wing. Start worrying when you can't see it any longer.'

Below us Venice was an irregular(不合常規的) brown biscuit surrounded by the crumbs of her islands. A straggling(四散) crack in the biscuit(餅乾) was the Grand Canal. At six hundred miles an hour, the Adriatic and the distant jagged line of Yugoslavia were gone in thirty minutes. Greece was blanketed in cloud and we were out over the Eastern Mediterranean in the time it took to consume a cupful of B.O.A.C. fruit salad. (My neighbour told me he liked sweet things. When I got to Los Angeles I must be sure and not forget to eat poison-berry pie.)

It was now two o'clock in the afternoon, G.M.T., but we were hastening(加快) towards the night and dusk(黃昏) came to meet us. An hour more of slow, spectacular(壯麗的) sunset and blue-black night and then Beirut showed up ahead—a sprawl(伸開四肢躺) of twinkling hundreds-and-thousands under an Arabian Nights new moon that dived down into the oil lands as the Comet banked to make her landing. Beirut is a crooked town and, when we came to rest, I advised my neighbour to leave nothing small on his seat, and particularly not his extremely expensive camera. I said that we were now entering the thieving areas of the world. Someone would get it. The hatch clanged(發出噹啷聲) open and the first sticky fingers of the East reached in.

'Our Man in the Lebanon' was there to meet me, full of the gossip(閒言閒語) of the bazaars(中東市場). Beirut is the great smuggling(走私) junction(樞紐) of the world. Diamonds thieved from Sierra Leone come in here for onward passage to Germany, cigarettes and pornography(色情書刊) from Tangier, arms for the sheikhs(阿拉伯酋長) of Araby and drugs from Turkey. Gold? Yes, said my friend. Did I remember the case brought by the Bank of England in the Italian courts against a ring that was minting real gold sovereigns containing the exactly correct amount of gold? The Bank of England had finally won their case in Switzerland, but now another ring had gone one better. They were minting gold sovereigns in Aleppo and now saving a bit on the gold content. These were for India. Only last week there had been a big Indian buyer in Beirut. He had bought sacks(大布袋) of sovereigns and flown them to a neighbouring port where he had put them on board his private yacht(遊艇). Then he sailed to Goa in Portuguese India. From there, with the help of conniving(搞陰謀的) Indian frontier(邊境) officials, the gold would go on its way to the bullion brokers in Bombay. There was still this mad thirst for gold in India. The premium was not what it had been after the war, only about sixty per cent now instead of the old three hundred per cent, but it was still well worth the trouble and occasional danger.

Opium? Yes, there was a steady stream coming in from Turkey; also heroin, which is refined opium, from Germany via Turkey and Syria. Every now and then the American Federal Narcotics Bureau in Rome would trace a gang back to Beirut and, with the help of local police, there would be a raid(突然襲擊) and a handful of prison sentences. But Interpol(國際刑事警察組織), he urged, really should have an office in Beirut. There would be plenty to keep them busy. I asked where all the drugs were going to. To Rome and then down to Naples for shipment to America. That's where the consumption was, and the big prices. Arms smuggling wasn't doing too well now that Cyprus was more or less settled. Beirut had been the centre of that traffic—mostly Italian and Belgian arms—but now there was only a trickle(零星) going over, and the sheikhs had enough of the light stuff and wanted tanks and planes, and these were too big to smuggle.

We sat sipping thin lemonade(檸檬水) in the pretentious(矯飾的), empty airport with scabby(卑劣的) walls and sand blown from the desert on the vast, empty floors. The doors had been locked upon us and our passports(護照) impounded(沒收) by surly Lebanese police. Flight announcements(通告) were first in Arabic—the hallmark of a small state playing at power. It was good to get back to one's comfortable seat in the Comet and to be offered chewing gum by a beautiful Indian stewardess(女服務員) in an emerald(翠綠色) sari(莎麗服) with gold trim—not only the 'magic carpet' routine but necessary to cope with our changing groups of local passengers. We soared up again into the brilliant night sky and then there was nothing but the desert and, forty thousand feet below, the oil wells flaring(燃燒的) in the night. (My neighbour said that the lavatories at Beirut had been dreadful(糟糕的). He added that in an Iowa hotel the lavatories were marked 'Pointers' and 'Setters'.)

I had armed myself for the flight with the perfect book for any journey—Eric Ambler's wonderful thriller Passage of Arms, a proof copy of which had been given to me by Mr Frere of Heinemann's for the trip. I had only been able to read a few pages and I was now determined(已下決心的) to get back to it. I offered another book to my neighbour but he said he hadn't got much time for books. He said that whenever someone asked him whether he had read this or that, he would say, 'No, sir. But have you red hairs on your chest?' I said that I was sorry but I simply must read my book as I had to review it. The lie was effective and my companion went off to sleep hogging more than his share of the arm-rest.

Bahrein is, without question, the scruffiest(骯髒的) international airport in the world. The washing facilities would not be tolerated(容忍) in a prison and the slow fans in the ceilings of the bedraggled(破舊的) hutments(臨時營房) hardly stirred the flies. Stale, hot air blew down off the desert and there was a chirrup(蟲聲) of unknown insects. A few onlookers(旁觀者) shuffled about with their feet barely off the ground, spitting and scratching themselves. This is the East one is glad to get through quickly.

Up again over the Arabian Sea with, below us, the occasional winking(閃爍) flares of the smuggling dhows(單桅三角帆船) that hug the coast from India down past the Aden Protectorate and East Africa, carrying cargoes(貨物) of illegal(非法的) Indian emigrants(移民) on their way to join fathers and uncles and cousins in the cheap labour markets of Kenya and Tanganyika. Without passports, they are landed on the African continent anywhere south of the Equator and disappear into the bidonvilles(窮困城鎮) that are so much more hospitable(適宜生活的) than the stews(燜) of Bombay. From now on, we shall be in the lands of baksheesh(小費), squeeze and graft, which rule from the smallest coolie(苦力) to the Mr Bigs in government.

Ten thousand feet below us a baby thunderstorm flashed violet. My neighbour said he must get a picture of it, groped(摸尋) under his seat. Consternation(驚惶失措)! A hundred and fifty pounds' worth of camera and lenses had been filched(偷)! Already the loot(掠奪品) would be on its way up the pipeline(渠道) to the bazaars. The long argument with the chief steward about responsibility(責任) and insurance(保險) went on far across the great black vacuum(似在真空中) of India.

More thunderstorms fluttered(顫動) in the foothills of the Himalayas while B.O.A.C. stuffed(吃飽的) us once again, like Strasbourg geese, with food and drink. I had no idea what time it was or when I was going to get any sleep between these four- or five-hour leaps across the world. My watch said midnight G.M.T. and this tricked me into drinking a whisky and soda in the pretentious airport at New Delhi where the sad Benares brassware(黃銅製品) in unsaleable Indian shapes and sizes collects dust in the forlorn(孤苦伶仃的) showcases(玻璃陳列櫃). Alas(唉), before I had finished it, a pale dawn was coming up and great flocks(鳥群) of awakened crows fled silently overhead towards some distant breakfast among the rubbish(垃圾) dumps outside India's capital(首都).

India has always depressed(消沉的) me. I can't bear the universal dirt and squalor(骯髒) and the impression, false I am sure, that everyone is doing no work except living off his neighbour. And I am desolated(傷心寂寞的) by the outward(外表的) manifestations(顯示) of the two great Indian religions. Ignorant(無知的), narrow-minded, bigoted(冥頑不靈的)? Of course I am. But perhaps this extract(摘錄) from India's leading newspaper, boxed and in heavy black type on the back page of the Statesman of November 21st, 1959, will help to excuse(原諒) my prejudices(偏見):



10 YEARS' PRISON FOR KIDNAPPING(誘拐)

New Delhi, Nov. 16

A bill(法案) providing deterrent(遏制的) punishment(懲罰) for kidnapping minors(未成年人) and maiming(使殘廢) and employing them for begging, was introduced in the Lok Sabha today by the Home Minister, Pandit Pant.

The bill seeks(追求) to amend(修訂) the relevant(相關聯的) sections of the Indian Penal Code, and provides for imprisonment extending up to 10 years and fine in the case of kidnapping or obtaining custody(監禁) of minors for employing them for begging, and life imprisonment(囚禁) and fine in the case of maiming.—P.T.I.



Back on the plane, the assistant stewardess wore the Siamese equivalent of a cheong sam. Five hours away was Bangkok. One rejected sleep and breakfast for the splendour(輝煌) below and away to port where the Himalayas shone proudly and the tooth of Everest looked small and easy to climb. Why had no one ever told me that the mouths of the Ganges are one of the wonders of the world? Gigantic brown meanderings between walls and islands of olive green, each one of a hundred tributaries seeming ten times the size of the Thames. A short neck of the Bay of Bengal and then down over the rice fields of Burma to the heavenly green pastures(牧場) of Thailand, spread out among wandering rivers and arrow-straight canals like some enchanted garden. This was the first place of really startling beauty I had so far seen and the temperature of ninety-two degrees in the shade on the tarmac(鋪有柏油碎石的飛機跑道) did nothing to spoil(糟蹋) the impact(巨大影響) of the country where I would advise other travellers to have their first view of the true Orient. The minute air hostess, smiling the first true smile, as opposed to an air-hostess smile, since London, told us to 'forrow me'.

In spite of the mosquitoes as large as Messerschmitts and the wringing(擰乾) humidity(濕度), everyone seems to agree that Bangkok is a dream city, and I blamed myself for hurrying on to Hong Kong. In only one hour, one still got the impression of the topsy-turvy, childlike(單純的) quality of the country and an old Siamese hand, a chance acquaintance(泛泛之交), summed it up with a recent cutting from a Bangkok newspaper. This was a plaintive(傷感的) article by a high police official remonstrating(抗議) with tourists for accosting(上前搭訕) girls in the streets. These street-walkers were unworthy(不配的) representatives(代表) of Siamese womanhood(女性，婦女). A tourist had only to call at the nearest police station to be given names and addresses and prices of not only the most beautiful, but the most respectable, girls in the city.

Back in the Comet that, after six thousand miles, seemed as fresh and trim as it had at London Airport, it was half an hour across the China Sea before one's clothes came unstuck from one's body. Then it was only another hour or so before the Chinese communist-owned outer islands of Hong Kong showed up below and we began to drift down to that last little strip of tarmac set in one of the most beautiful views in the world. It was nearly five o'clock and just over twenty-six hours and seven thousand miles from London. Twenty minutes late! Take a letter please, Miss Trueblood.
