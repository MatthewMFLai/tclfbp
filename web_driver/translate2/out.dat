Theywere strangers in New York. One of them, a tall, fair girl, dressed in adark blue tailor suit, furs, and a close-fitting velvet hat, was severalyears older than her companion, who was small with dark eyes, a sallowskin and an oddly unconventional appearance which seemed to accord withher costume, a brown serge cape, a gown of the same material and anold-fashioned poke bonnet of flowered silk.In another hour the shops would close and the crowds come pouring forthinto the streets."Are you tired, Elce?  I had forgotten you were never in New York savethe one day when you landed.  The hotel is only a few blocks further on,yet perhaps it might have been wiser not to have attempted to walk fromthe station."Bettina Graham, who was carrying a small suitcase, made an effort toslacken her pace, her companion with quicker, shorter steps keepingclose beside her."No, I am not tired," she answered, "it is only the noise that confusesme.  I never could have imagined anything like it.  Yet I think I oncedreamed of a city like this, of tall towers and streets that are ravinesbetween high cliffs, with the same bright blue sky overhead."The older girl smiled."You are a fanciful person, but dreaming in New York is a dangerouspastime, where one must watch every foot of the way."The afternoon was warm and brilliant, with only a faint suggestion offrost, the shop windows filled with brilliant displays, the streetscrowded with automobiles.Bettina’s expression changed, her eyes shone, her lips parted slightlyas the color swept into her cheeks."New York is fascinating, isn’t it?  One forgets how fascinating evenwhen one has been away only a short time.  I do hope I may be able tospend the winter here! But for you, Elce, who have lived almost yourentire life in the country, it must be a wholly new experience.  Well,we are both runaways this afternoon!"There is Mrs. Burton’s hotel just around the corner of the next block.At this hour, between five and six o’clock, she must be at home."Unconsciously Bettina began to move more rapidly, with the appearance ofa runner whose goal is nearly in sight."I’ll send up our cards and she will see us at once.  I am sorry ourtrain was two hours late.  I presume I ought to have telegraphed.  Onedoes not enjoy the idea of being alone in New York."  Bettina laughed."Don’t be troubled, there is not the faintest chance of such a disaster.Now that our Camp Fire guardian has returned to the stage and her playbecome one of the greatest successes of the winter, I suppose she doeshave to excuse herself to a good many persons, yet she will scarcelydecline to see us."Not talking to her companion so much as to herself, Bettina at the sametime was studying the faces of the passers-by, divided between herinterest in New York, the contagion of the brilliant autumn day and herundoubted nervousness over some personal problem.Reaching the desired hotel, after an instant’s hesitation, the two girlsentered, Bettina feeling an unaccustomed awkwardness and embarrassment.Notwithstanding the fact that she had traveled many miles in the pastfew years in her own country and in Europe, this was the first occasionwhen she had been without a chaperon.Declining to surrender her suitcase, Bettina asked the clerk to announceher arrival to Mr. and Mrs. Richard Burton.  In a measure she feltprepared to have her request refused, as Mrs. Burton would probably wishto be excused to visitors at this hour.  She meant to be insistent, evenif necessary to telephone her own name.The clerk shook his head."Sorry, miss, but Captain and Mrs. Burton are not in; they left thishotel four or five days ago and took an apartment of their own.""You don’t mean they are no longer living here?"To her own ears Bettina’s voice sounded more startled than it should."Then will you be kind enough to give me their new address, as I wish tofind them at once."She thought she saw a faint look of sympathy and regret on the clerk’sface."Sorry again, but Captain Burton left strict orders their new addresswas to be given to no one.  They do not wish to see strangers.  Theirfriends they intend notifying themselves.  Perhaps you want Mrs. Burtonto help you to go on the stage, so many young women call on her for thispurpose and she has been giving up so much time to them, Captain Burtondoes not wish her to be disturbed in the future."Bettina flushed and frowned."No, I am not looking for work and I am not a stranger to Mrs. Burton.She and Captain Burton would wish you to tell me where they are living.Mrs. Burton is a kind of relative, or at least she is an intimatefriend."The clerk smiled."That is what everyone says.  I regret not being able to oblige you, butorders are orders."As if Bettina were no longer demanding his attention he turned to someone who had been waiting and was now inquiring for a room.Wishing to discuss a question of great importance to her own happinesswith her Camp Fire guardian, Bettina had run away from home.  The actwas not premeditated. When she made her sudden decision her mother andfather chanced to be spending a few days away from Washington.  Norwould they have objected to her journey, save to prefer that she have anolder companion than the little English girl, Elce, originally known asChitty, whom the Camp Fire girls had known during the summer in "MerrieEngland."Bettina had not seen her Camp Fire guardian in six months, not sincetheir parting at Half Moon Lake.  Of late, not once, but many times hermother had announced that she would like the benefit of Polly Burton’sadvice on the question which divided them.So Bettina suddenly had set out on her pilgrimage to New York with thisend in view.  To arrive unheralded and not find Mrs. Burton, to becompelled to spend the night with Elce as her only companion would butdeepen her mother’s impression that she possessed neither the judgmentnor experience necessary for the independence she desired.Nothing would be gained by looking inside her pocket book.  She knewexactly the amount of money it contained.After paying for her own and Elce’s tickets and an expensive lunch onthe train she had counted it carefully.  Seven dollars and forty centsthen had seemed a sufficient amount when she expected to be with herCamp Fire guardian in a few hours; it was woefully insufficient to meetthe expenses of two persons in New York.There was one friend to whom she might appeal, but this would make herpresent difficulty with her mother the greater. Surely there must besome method of discovering her Camp Fire guardian, if only she were notso stupid that she had no idea what to do next.  In any case she wouldnot remain longer in the lobby of the hotel and she declined to questionthe clerk a third time.  In the street she would receive freshinspiration.She and Elce left the hotel.Outdoors no new idea immediately occurred to her.  It seemed strangethat her mother had not mentioned Mrs. Burton’s change of address: asthey never failed to write each other once a week, undoubtedly she mustknow.  Then Bettina recalled the fact that she and her mother had hadbut little to say to each other of late, since no matter upon whatsubject they started to talk, always the conversation veered to thedifference between them."Don’t be worried, dear, I shall be able to think what to do in a fewmoments," Bettina remarked, with more courage than conviction.  "It wasridiculous for the hotel management to decline to give me Tante’s changeof address.  She and Captain Burton will both be annoyed; the clerkshould have known they might wish some exception to be made to theirorder."Elce nodded, regretting that she was unable to offer any advice and yetperfectly content to abide by Bettina’s judgment. In a strange andunfamiliar world, Bettina was her one anchor.  Sent to a boardingschool, from loneliness and longing for the outdoors, Elce had fallenill, and unable to continue at school, Bettina’s home had been herrefuge.At present the younger girl was finding it difficult to keep herattention concentrated upon the object of their quest, the city noisesso excited and confused her.  With her strange musical gift she long hadbeen able to reproduce the country sounds, the singing of certain birds,the wind in the trees, now she seemed faintly aware of some hiddenharmony amid the thousand discords of the city streets.Again her companion brought her back from her day dreaming."I believe I will look in the telephone book, as it is just possibleTante may have kept her former telephone number and had it transferredto her new address.  If you do not mind waiting, here is a publictelephone booth."Five minutes later with her expression a little more cheerful, Bettinarejoined the younger girl."I have discovered an apartment in Fifth Avenue which may be Tante’s.At least it is occupied by a Mr. and Mrs. Richard Burton.  As no oneanswered the telephone, suppose we take the Fifth Avenue bus and see ifby a stroke of good fortune we have located the right place.  I do hopeso.  If not, I suppose we can find a quiet hotel and spend the nightthere, or if not go to a Y.W.C.A. and explain our difficulty.  In themorning I fear we must return to Washington and there humbly inquire forTante’s address.  I might telegraph of course, but as mother and fatherare not at home, to find we have vanished before they receive the letterI left for them, will annoy and frighten them.  Heigh-ho, it is apuzzling world, Elce dear; when I thought I was attempting a simplejourney for a good cause here I am in an entirely unexpected tangle!"In spite of her uncertainty, for she had but little assurance of findingher guardian, Bettina could not fail to enjoy the ride up Fifth Avenuein the crowded bus.  Not yet dark, still here and there lights wereshining in the office buildings, while the throngs of people hurryinghome grew constantly larger.  The bus passed the low, classic stonebuilding she recognized as the New York Public Library, then a group ofmagnificent houses and hotels and the entrance to Central Park.At Sixty-first Street and Fifth Avenue Bettina and her companiondismounted.Half a block further on they entered a handsome apartment building."Will you telephone up and ask either Mr. or Mrs. Richard Burton to seeMiss Bettina Graham," Bettina asked the elevator boy.  "I won’t giveyour name, Elce; it is better that I explain later and the two namesmight be confusing," she whispered, more uneasy than she cared toconfess even to herself.The reply brought a flush of color to Bettina’s cheeks.  She was to"come up at once.""I am afraid I am a good deal relieved. In truth I am so tired I shalltumble into bed as soon as dinner is over and not try to have a longtalk with Tante before morning. Probably she would prefer me to wait, asshe will soon be leaving for the theater. I hope her apartment is notvery small, but in any case she will have to find room for us to-night,"Bettina managed to confide on the way up to the fifth floor.The moment she had rung the bell, the door opened.Bettina and Elce found themselves confronting a young man of abouteighteen or nineteen years of age."Won’t you come in?  I believe you wish to see my mother.  I did notcatch your name, but she will be at home in a few moments.  Theapartment has been deserted all afternoon, but I am sure she won’t bemuch longer away."An absurd instant Bettina forgot her dignity and the number of her yearsand suffered an impulse to shed tears.  She was tired and it was late.She felt the responsibility for her companion.  Of course she should nothave rushed to New York in this impetuous fashion without her mother’sknowledge, or informing her Camp Fire guardian of her intention."You are very kind.  I am sorry to have troubled you, but it is not yourmother I am looking for.  I was afraid I was making a mistake.  I amseeking for another Mrs. Richard Burton and merely hoped that this mightprove to be her address.""You are convinced it is not."  The young fellow’s manner was so kindthat Bettina felt slightly less depressed. "Suppose you tell mesomething of the Mrs. Burton you _do_ wish to find, give me some kind ofa clue and I may be able to help you.""Well, I scarcely know how to explain. I came to New York under theimpression that Mr. and Mrs. Burton were at a hotel where I know theyhave been for a number of months and unexpectedly learned they hadmoved.""Surely you could have inquired where they have gone!"Scarcely conscious of how cross and tired she appeared, Bettina frowned."Oh, of course I inquired, but the hotel clerk refused to inform me.Mrs. Burton’s play this winter is a great success and I suppose so manypeople have called on her that she felt obliged to refuse to permit heraddress to be given to strangers, and I was unable to convince the clerkI was an old friend."Bettina and Elce were about to turn away."Do you mean you are trying to discover the Mrs. Burton who is PollyO’Neill Burton, and is acting in the new play known as ’A Tide in theAffairs’?  I saw it only a few nights ago.  Why do you not go to hertheater and inquire where she lives.  The theater is at Forty-seventhand Broadway.  If you do not receive the information you could waituntil Mrs. Burton arrives.  I wish you would allow my mother to go withyou.  If I were only another girl I might be useful.  As I am not, Idon’t dare propose to accompany you.  But there are two of you, so Isuppose you will be all right, although I don’t like the idea of yourgoing to a theater at this hour alone."Bettina smiled, forgetting in her evident relief to be as conventionalas was usual with her."I am very much obliged to you.  I don’t see why I did not think of yoursuggestion myself.  There is no reason to trouble you any further.  Ofcourse yours is the proper solution of our difficulty, I knew there mustbe one if I could only discover it.  Good-by and thank you."An hour later Bettina Graham and Elce were entering an old house inGramercy Park which recently had been made over into apartments.  Andwithin a few moments Mrs. Burton’s arms were about Bettina."My dear, how lovely it is to see you after so long!  But what hasbrought you here at this hour without letting me know? Surely nothinghas happened to Betty or to you!  You have not come to tell me yourmother is ill and wants me?"Bettina shook her head."No, dear, there is no reason to be uneasy.  I simply wish to talk overa question with you, partly because you are my Camp Fire guardian, butmore I suppose because you are yourself.  I left Washington suddenly anddid not think it worth while to telegraph.  You see I did not dream youhad moved, or that I would have any difficulty in discovering you.  Butlet me tell you the whole story in the morning.  Elce and I are tiredand hungry.  Can you find a place for us?""Don’t be absurd, Bettina.  Think, dear, I have not seen one of my CampFire girls in six months!  Come and let us find Richard, he is in thedrawing-room; then we will have dinner as I must be off to the theatersoon afterwards.  We can have a long, uninterrupted talk after breakfasttomorrow."                              *CHAPTER II*                           *THE GENERATIONS*At ten o’clock the next morning Bettina and Mrs. Burton were in hersmall sitting-room with the door closed.The room was characteristic of its owner--filled with warm, soft colorsin shades of rose and blue, a few beautiful pieces of furniture, a fewphotographs, two exquisite paintings on the wall.In a large chair before the fire, with a small table drawn up besideher, Mrs. Burton had just finished breakfast and was reading her mail,while Bettina wandered about examining the rosewood desk, the pictures,dipping her nose into a blue bowl filled with violets which had arrivednot a quarter of an hour before and which Bettina herself had arranged."I have a letter from your mother, Princess; she is not writing fromWashington and has not yet heard you are with me. However, she says shewishes that we could have a talk together," Mrs. Burton remarked,dropping into the fanciful title the Camp Fire girls had bestowed uponBettina Graham years before, and which they now only used occasionally."Come and make your confession, dear, for besides being by naturecurious I can’t help being troubled.  Surely, Bettina, you have not beenfalling in love with some one whom your mother does not approve!  If so,I am going to be equally difficult.  When I became your Camp Fireguardian long ago, and you were all small girls, I never considered theresponsibilities that your growing up would thrust upon me, and haveoften thought of resigning the honor since."Bettina came and stood before the fire with her hands clasped in frontof her and looking down at the older woman, who was gazing up at herhalf smiling and half frowning."I don’t see what especial difference your resigning as our Camp Fireguardian would make, Tante.  We would all continue to come to you withour problems and you would be wounded and offended should we choose anyone else.  It is true most of us are growing rather old for the CampFire, and yet it has become so important a part of our lives no one ofus would dream of giving it up.  By the way, you are looking wonderfullywell, as if your work were agreeing with you better than I thoughtpossible.""Yes, I am well, thank you.  Is it so difficult to confide what you cameto New York to tell me?  I don’t like to think of your search for meyesterday and the possibility that you might not have found me. WhenCaptain Burton, believing I was seeing too many people, left the orderat the hotel I was afraid that some one might come seeking me whom Ishould regret missing.  Won’t you sit down?"Bettina shook her head."No, I would rather not.  Somehow it is harder to begin my story than Idreamed! You see, I want so much to have you feel as I do about what Iam going to tell you, since it means my whole life, and yet I amdreadfully afraid you won’t.  As you know, mother and I have disagreedabout many small matters since I was a little girl.  I was obstinate, Isuppose, and she never has wholly recovered from her disappointment thatI am so unlike her in my disposition and tastes.  In the past father andI have seemed to understand each other, until now when he too is not insympathy with me.  Oh, I realize I am coming to my point slowly, but youmust let me try and tell you in my own fashion.  You care so much formother I fear your affection for her may prejudice you against me.""Isn’t that a strange speech, Bettina, as if I did not care for you aswell, and as if there could be any division of interest between yourmother and you?"The Camp Fire guardian spoke slowly, studying Bettina closely.  Morethan she realized, in the past six months Bettina had changed; shelooked older and more serious and did not appear in especially goodhealth.  She had grown thinner.  Under her eyes were shadows and abouther lips discontented lines.With the first suggestion of criticism her manner had altered.Years before when Bettina was much younger, during the first months asSunrise Camp Fire guardian, Mrs. Burton had not understood Bettina’sreserve, the little coldness which made her apparently express lessaffection than the other girls.  Later, when this proved to be moreshyness than coldness, she had come to believe that, although Bettinadid not care for many persons, her affections were deep and abiding andthat between them lay a friendship as strong as was possible between agirl and a so much older woman."Yes, Bettina has altered more than I dreamed," she reflected."I am sorry to hear you say, Tante, that mother and I cannot have aninterest apart, because that is exactly what has occurred," Bettinaannounced.  "We have differed, we do still differ upon a question ofsuch importance that I doubt if our old relation can ever be exactly thesame.  Of course I care for mother as much as I ever cared, although shedeclines to believe it.  She already has said that her affection for meis not the same.""Nonsense, Bettina," Mrs. Burton answered.  "Please tell me what youmean more clearly and be prepared to have me frank with you.  If youfeel you will be angry unless I agree with you, my opinion will not beof value.""Oh, I am accustomed to everybody’s being frank in their disapproval ofme whenever they hear what I wish to do.  I do not expect you to agreewith me, Tante, but I did hope you would listen to my side of thequestion and not think me altogether selfish and inconsiderate, which isthe family point of view at present."In Bettina’s manner there was a subtle change, her tone lessself-assured, her expression showing more appeal and less challenge.In the same instant Mrs. Burton appreciated that to fail Bettina now wasto fail Bettina’s mother as well, even to end the long friendship uponwhich they both depended.  Beneath Bettina’s assumption of hardness andwilfulness, she was sincerely troubled.  Moreover, she was facing somedecision vital to her future."Come and sit down beside me, dear, you look so tall and old toweringabove me. And suppose we do not presume in the beginning that we aregoing to misunderstand each other.  You want to confide in me and I amglad you do; now go on and I shall not interrupt."At the change in her Camp Fire guardian’s manner, Bettina’s facesoftened, she seemed younger and gentler.  Sitting down on a low chairshe leaned forward, placing her clasped hands in the older woman’s lapand gazing directly at her with eyes that were clear and gallant, evenif they were a little obstinate and cold.Mrs. Burton experienced a sensation of relief.  In Bettina’s oppositionto her mother there could be nothing seriously wrong.She began to speak at once:"Perhaps my confession is not so dreadful as you fear, Tante.  Theunfortunate thing is that mother and I cannot seem to agree and that wehave argued the question so many times until of late we have not onlyargued but quarreled.  Well, I shall begin at the beginning!  When wesaid good-by to one another at Tahawus cabin,[*] I remained at home inWashington for only a few weeks and then mother and I opened our summerhouse.  We both wrote you that she and father and Tony and MargueriteArnot and I spent several perfect months together motoring and sailingand swimming with one another and with the people who came to see us.David Hale came now and then, and Tony’s college friends, besidesWashington friends and Sally and Alice Ashton for a few days. There wasonly one small difficulty.  I became intimate with an older woman whowas boarding not far away.  Mother did not consider her particularlydesirable.  She was polite to her as she is to most people and did notreally object to Miss Merton until she began to feel that she was havingmore influence over me than she liked. Miss Merton is a settlementworker and used to tell me of her life and the people she is thrown withand the help she is able to give them.  I found the account of her workvery fascinating, until mother began to feel I was neglecting my familyand preferring Miss Merton’s society.  This was not true; I did not careso much for Miss Merton herself, although I do admire her.  It was herexperiences among the poor which interested me so keenly; the clubs andclasses and the nursing and the effort to teach our immigrants more ofthe spirit and opportunities of the United States."[*] See "Camp Fire Girls at Half Moon Lake"."Yes, I know, my dear, social settlement work is not a new discovery.Was it to you?  What in the world can this have to do with you?  Surelyyour mother did not oppose your friendship with this Miss Merton to suchan extent that you have made a tragedy of it!""No, of course not.  What happened was just this.  I became sointerested in social settlement work that I have decided it is the workto which I wish to devote my life.  I thought over the question forweeks and then I spoke to mother.  I told her that I could not possiblydo what she desired for me and make my début in Washington society thiswinter.  The very idea makes me wretched!  I assured her she could notrealize what an utter waste of time a society life appears to me.Besides, I am not in any way fitted for it.  I asked her to allow me tospend this winter studying social settlement work.  Then if I found Icould be useful I would choose it as my life work.  You know I neverhave felt that I wished to marry and for the last two years, when wewere not busy with the reconstruction work in France I have been morerestless than any one realized. I must find my own road, yet I did notknow in what direction it lay.""Yes, well, go on, Bettina," Mrs. Burton urged, smiling a littleinwardly and yet conscious of Bettina’s immense seriousness, which madeher egotism pardonable."Well, mother at first simply declined to pay any attention to what Itold her. Afterwards when she began to see that I was in earnest shedeclined to have me mention the subject to her again.  She announcedthat her plans were made; I was to make my début early in October and tospend the winter at home.  She declared that social settlement workshould be left to older people and to girls who had fewer opportunities.She said other things of course, but the important fact is that sherefuses to permit me the choice of my own life.  Because she cares forsociety and people and being beautiful and admired is no reason why Ishould care for the same things.  If I were older I should do as I like.Miss Merton has charge of a settlement house on the east side in NewYork and would take me in to live with her."Bettina put up her hands to her flushed cheeks."I suppose this sounds as if I did not care in the least for what motherwishes, and yet I do.  I am sorry to disappoint her; I wish I had beenwhat she desired.  Yet I cannot for that reason change my own nature andmy own inclinations.  Do please say something, Tante; it is not like youto remain silent so long.""I did not wish to interrupt you and I am feeling sorry for Betty.""Sorry for mother?  Of course I expected you would be; everybody issorry for her. They always have been sorry that she should have adaughter who has neither her beauty, nor charm, nor sweetness; the factthat I am a failure in society and wish to lead my own life is only onething more. You need not for a moment suppose that the sympathy is notall with mother.  I regret having troubled you.  I thought when you werea girl your family and friends were bitterly opposed to your going onthe stage and that regardless of them you did the thing you wished.  Butyou are a genius and have proved your right to do as you like.  Iunderstand that makes all the difference in the world.  It evenjustifies sacrificing other people."Hurt and angry, and not sure of her own position, Bettina felt thecommon impulse to strike at some one else.  The moment after her finalspeech she was sorry to have made it."Have I sacrificed other people to have my own way, Bettina?  I wonder?If you mean that I returned to the stage in opposition to AuntPatricia’s wish, it is true," Mrs. Burton answered."You would not have referred to this had you known how unhappy it hasmade me.  Since we parted at Tahawus cabin Aunt Patricia has neverspoken to me or answered one of my letters.  She has not allowed me tosee her, although I have been twice to Boston for no other purpose.Yet, Bettina, are the circumstances the same? I do not wish to hurt AuntPatricia, but I am not a girl by many years, and I chose my professionlong ago.  I explained that my husband and I needed the money I am ableto make and could not continue to accept Aunt Patricia’s generosity.She has no real objection to my return to the stage except the mistakennotion that I’m not strong enough and the fact that she cannot allow meto do what her will opposes. Dear Aunt Patricia is nothing, if not anautocrat!  Still there are hours when I miss her so much, when it hurtsto have her believe me ungrateful, until I almost regret what I havedone, pleased as I am at the success of my new play.  I often wish I hadtried more persuasion with Aunt Patricia. But, Bettina, I never claimedto be a model person, and as you seem to feel I have no right to judgeyou, suppose we do not discuss your difficulty."Flushing Bettina bit her lips and lowered her lids over her grey eyes."I don’t wonder you say that, Tante, and I deserve it.  To be rude toyou does not help my cause, does it?  Certainly it would not withmother.  Besides you know I thoroughly approved of your return to thestage and think Aunt Patricia utterly unreasonable.  There isn’t anylikeness between my position and yours in this instance.  What I wantyou to do is to try and think how you felt when you were a girl and allyour family and friends opposed your going on the stage.  Didn’t theytell you that you were selfish and unreasonable and breaking people’shearts from sheer obstinacy?  I don’t wish to be disagreeable, I have nogreat talent as you have, I just want you to try to feel a littlesympathy for me, even if you feel more for mother."The Camp Fire guardian smiled and shook her head, yet laid her hand onBettina’s."My dear, you are making a more difficult request than you realize.  Itis so hard to go back to one’s past that most of us only understand ourown generation.  You Camp Fire girls should have taught me more wisdom!Of course I sympathize with you if you are unhappy, Bettina, and feelyourself in the wrong place, yet I am sorrier for your mother, becauseyou cannot possibly realize how much you are hurting her.  She never hasbelieved you cared for her deeply and now that you are not willing tospend even one season with her in doing what she wishes, she is the morefirmly convinced that you have no affection for her.  You talk a greatdeal of not having your mother’s beauty and charm; well, perhaps not inthe same degree; but Betty, I know, is very proud of you and thinks youare infinitely cleverer than she and that you feel this yourself.""Tante, you are not fair," Bettina interrupted."Then perhaps you would rather I would not go on.""Yes, I want to know what you think, only what you have said is absurd.Mother never has been proud of me, although this is scarcely her fault.She agrees with me that I am not a success in society, only she insiststhat this is because I won’t try to make myself popular.""Do you try?""Well, no, not especially, but why should I?  If I were allowed to dowhat I like, to give all my energy and the little knowledge I possess tohelp people less fortunate than I am, I should try as I have never triedto accomplish anything in my life.""You are not willing to make any effort to fulfill your mother’s wish.Suppose we do not discuss the subject, Bettina, any further at present.We are both tired.  I telegraphed your mother last night and am writingto-day to ask if you may make me a visit."There was a knock at the door and Mrs. Burton arose."I told you I did not wish to be disturbed," she protested when the dooropened and another girl entered.This girl possessed an apparently colorless manner and personality, shehad ash-brown hair and eyes and the question of her appearance wouldscarcely occur to any one who knew her but slightly.  Juliet Temple wasnot a member of the Sunrise Camp Fire.  She had been introduced to theCamp Fire guardian and the group of girls by Mrs. Burton’s husbandduring the winter they had spent together in the Adirondacks.Not popular with the rest of the household, Juliet Temple had continuedto live with Mrs. Burton in a position a little difficult to describe.Treated as a member of the family, she was useful to Mrs. Burton in avariety of ways, in fact she had come to depend upon her far more thanshe appreciated."Yes, I understood that you did not desire to be disturbed, but I thinkwhen you know who wishes to see you that you will feel differently,"Juliet said quietly.Accepting the cards that were offered her, Mrs. Burton exclaimed:"Bettina, you cannot guess who has arrived, unless you have arranged tosurprise me!  Not to have seen one of you Camp Fire girls in all thesemonths and now to have four of you appear at the same time scarcelyseems accidental."Bettina got up."I don’t know what you mean!"The Camp Fire guardian disappeared.A moment later, returning to her sitting-room she was accompanied bythree girls, one of them a tall girl with dusky black hair and eyes anda foreign appearance in spite of the fact that she was an American.The other two girls were sisters, although utterly unlike in appearance;one of them was tall and slightly angular with gray eyes and reddishhair.  The younger girl had golden brown hair and eyes, was small andsoftly rounded.  Her expression at the moment was one of demurehappiness."Vera Lagerloff, Alice Ashton and Sally Ashton, at your service,Bettina," the Sunrise Camp Fire guardian announced with a curtsey."But, Bettina Graham, how in the world do you happen to be in New Yorkat this time?"Bettina laughed."That is exactly the question I was about to ask of you."                             *CHAPTER III*                             *FUTURE PLANS*"We are spending the winter in New York; actually I have been intendingto write you for weeks, Bettina, but have been too busy; Alice and I aretaking special courses at Columbia and Sally is here keeping house forus," Vera Lagerloff answered."Have I talked so much, Tante, that you have had no opportunity to tellme so important a piece of news?" Bettina inquired.After finding chairs for her guests, Mrs. Burton had seated herself on acouch beside Sally Ashton.  She now shook her head."No, Bettina, I could not have told you, since I had no idea the girlswere in New York.  You see, they have never before been to see me or letme hear where they were.  Have you been in town long?"There was a short, uncomfortable silence."About a month; but please let me explain," Alice Ashton said, seeingthat the other girls were waiting for her to assume the responsibilityof a reply.  "I realize this must seem strange to you, and I grant youit does look odd, as if we had lost all our affection and gratitude.And yet you can not believe this of us!""I have made no accusation," the Camp Fire guardian returned, yet in hertone and manner there was an unconscious accusation, which made itdifficult for Alice to continue."I am afraid you are wounded, Tante; I am sorry," she added awkwardlyand paused.Guardian of the Sunrise Camp Fire girls for a number of years, Mrs.Richard Burton, whose professional name was Polly O’Neill Burton, hadgiven up her career on the stage and traveled with the Camp Fire girlsin the west.  Later when the great war turned the world upside down shehad gone with them to Europe accompanied by a wealthy and eccentricspinster, Miss Patricia Lord.  After two years in France and a summer inEngland they had come back to their own country and on account of theCamp Fire guardian’s health had spent the preceding winter in theAdirondacks.[*][*] See "Camp Fire Girls" Series.With the close of the winter Mrs. Burton had returned to the stage andthe Camp Fire girls to their homes.  There had been no meeting betweenthem until to-day."Tante" was the title which the greater number of the Sunrise Camp Firegirls used in speaking to their guardian."Please don’t behave as if you were too wounded to be angry," SallyAshton remonstrated, moving closer to the older woman and slipping anarm about her. "And please remember that it is a good deal more of atrial for your Camp Fire girls to have been separated from you for allthese months than for you to have had a brief rest from their society.Some of us at least realize that you have given too much of yourself tous for the last few years when a so much larger public needed you.  Ican’t tell you how proud I am of your latest success.  I have read dozenof notices in the papers and the critics all say that you are morewonderful than ever."Mrs. Burton smiled."You are very complimentary, Sally dear, and of course I am immenselyflattered. Nevertheless this does not explain why you girls have nevercome near me for a month, or taken the trouble to write or telephone.This would not have interfered seriously with the holiday which you seemto feel I have required."Rising, Alice Ashton came over and stood before her guardian, herexpression unusually gentle and affectionate.  Ordinarily Alice was nottactful, although sincerity and a fine sense of honor were her rulingcharacteristics."See here, Tante, we are in an uncomfortable position and there isnothing to do save tell you the entire story and let you judge.  Youwill say frankly whether you think we have been right or wrong.  I feelsure that Sally and Vera have felt as I do, when I say there hasscarcely been a day since our arrival in New York when we have notthought of you and longed to see you.  We have been to your play severaltimes.""Why avoid me, dear?  What can it be that you find so difficult to say?I prefer to know.""Even if the reason will trouble you more than the fact?  The truth isthat Aunt Patricia would not agree to have us see you.""So Aunt Patricia’s influence is stronger than your feeling for me!Perhaps that is as it should be, but I can not altogether recognize whatI have done which makes Aunt Patricia not only refuse to have anythingto do with me herself, but wish to separate you Camp Fire girls from meas well.  I suppose she fears I may affect you with the ingratitude andobstinacy I possess.  As long as you were so compliant with AuntPatricia’s wish, Alice, why did you change?  Aunt Patricia has notchanged!""You are angry and hurt and I don’t know how to go on," Alice returned,her gray blue eyes darkening, a flush coming into her cheeks."Then don’t try, Alice," Sally interrupted. "Tante, please be sensibleand don’t make a tragedy over a situation that is uncomfortable enoughfor us all, goodness knows!  I have no gift of words but at least I canspeak plainly.  Alice and Vera both feel under obligation to AuntPatricia because she is paying their expenses in New York this winter.I have not been here so long as they have, in fact I only arrived a fewdays ago.  Aunt Patricia has rented a lovely little apartment for us andis being generous as only she can be.  So when she asked Alice and Veranot to come to see you, they considered that in a way they were obligedto do as she asked; I had no such feeling.  Aunt Patricia has beenspending a few days with us and this morning at breakfast, I had thematter out with her.  I simply told her I was coming to call on you,that she of course must do as she liked, but that I had been caring foryou all my life and had no idea of ever doing anything else.  If she didnot wish me to remain on at the apartment, she could of course send mehome.""Bravo, Sally!" Bettina Graham said softly under her breath."Of course," Sally added, "Alice and Vera have a different attitudetoward Aunt Patricia.  I have never been a favorite with her, as theyhave, or lived alone with her during their reconstruction work inFrance.  My own opinion is that Aunt Patricia wants to see you so muchherself that she is unwilling to have us see you, for fear we shall talkof you afterwards.  She made it a stipulation this morning when sheagreed we could come to see you that your name was not to be mentionedin her presence.  I really am awfully sorry for her.  She is very lonelythis winter I am afraid, shut up in her big house near Boston. She caresfor you more than any one in the world, and only comes to New Yorkoccasionally, I really believe to find out how you are, although no oneof us has been able to discover if she has been to see you act."During Sally Ashton’s long speech neither her sister, Alice, nor VeraLagerloff had appeared particularly serene.Vera Lagerloff was an unusual looking girl; at Sally’s words, her eyesnarrowed, her skin paled slightly and her lips parted over her firm,white teeth.  In all the years of their Camp Fire life together, no oneof her companions had ever seen Vera seriously angry, although shealways insisted that notwithstanding her American birth, she shared theRussian peculiarity.She looked more aggrieved at this moment than was customary."Sally is making a good story so far as she is concerned, although notso fortunate a one for us," she commented.  "Still the worst of it is,Mrs. Burton, that Alice and I cannot altogether deny the truth of whatshe has told you."  (Vera was always more formal in her manner towardthe Sunrise Camp Fire guardian than the other girls, and rarely used thetitle of "Tante.")  "We do feel under obligation to Aunt Patricia;neither Alice nor I could have afforded the winter at Columbia save forher kindness. Yet she did not insist on our not coming to see you, orletting you hear from us. She merely asked it as a favor, and only for alimited length of time.  One of the reasons she gave was that you hadchosen to separate yourself from us in order to give your time andenergy to your stage career and that we should not interfere. Alice andI were merely waiting to decide what was wisest and best.""Very well, I understand; please let us not discuss the question anyfurther.  Of course, Vera, dear, I know Aunt Patricia also told you Iwould be an unfortunate influence, but you are perfectly right not tospeak of this.  Do tell me what you and Alice are studying at Columbiaand whether you like New York and, oh, dozens of other things!"The Camp Fire guardian’s manner was sweet and friendly as her armencircled Sally and she gave her an affectionate embrace.Sally dimpled and smiled."You are a prophet, Tante.  Aunt Patricia suggested only this morningthat in order to have your own way, you disregarded every one’s wishes.The implication was that I bore a slight, but unfortunate resemblance toyou."At this the other girls laughed and the atmosphere cleared."Alice is preparing to study medicine and I am taking a course inarchitecture and another in domestic science.  Aunt Patricia talkssometimes of returning to France and spending the rest of her days overthere at her home for French war orphans.  She says if we wish and ourparents agree she may take Alice and me with her."Sally Ashton shook her head."Don’t worry, Tante, Aunt Patricia will never leave this country withoutyou."Mrs. Burton, who had been glancing into the flames which flickered in asmall open fire, now looked up."Really, Alice and Vera, I am glad you have done what Aunt Patriciawished, although at first I confess I was hurt and angry.  If she needsyou, you must fill her life as completely as you can.  I don’t agreewith Sally, much as I would like to. Aunt Patricia is singularlyunforgiving and must have lost all affection for me.  You’ll stay tolunch with us.  You and Bettina have not had a moment’s conversation andshe has a great deal to tell you.  I’ll go and see about things."After the Camp Fire guardian had disappeared from the room, BettinaGraham slipped into her place beside Sally."Do come and sit close to us in a Camp Fire square, if not a Camp Firecircle," Bettina urged.  "If you girls only knew how glad I am to seeyou and how your being here in New York makes me more than ever anxiousto do what I have been planning!  You know how I always have hated theidea of making my début in society.  Well, as the ordeal has drawnnearer, I have found myself hating the possibility more than ever.  Thissummer while we were at our new home, that we call ’The House by theBlue Lagoon,’ I at last made up my mind what I really wish to do.  Iwant to devote my life to social work and to begin by studying socialsettlement work in New York this winter."Sally Ashton sighed."Oh, dear, how did I ever wander into so serious a Camp Fire group?  Isthere no one of the Sunrise girls who does not wish for a career saveme?  Of course there are Peggy and Gerry, but they already have chosenmatrimony as their careers.""Do be quiet, Sally.  What a perfectly delightful idea, Bettina dear!Why can’t you spend the winter with us?  We have another small bed-roomin our apartment and I am sure Aunt Patricia will be delighted to haveyou with us," Alice Ashton urged.Bettina shook her head."No such good fortune, Alice!  Mother is entirely opposed to my wish andinsists upon my following her desire for me.  I ran away to New York totry to persuade Tante to use her influence with mother to permit me todo what I like, but I find she takes mother’s point of view altogether.We were discussing the subject when you came in and she had just told meshe thought it would be selfish and inconsiderate of me to argue thematter any further.  So I suppose I must go back to Washington and be awallflower all winter."I forgot to tell you that Elce, our little Lancashire girl, is herewith me.  She was ill at school and sent to me, as no one seemed able tofind anything the matter, save that she was so homesick and miserable.Now something has to be done for her and with her and I am so glad tohave the opportunity to ask your advice.  I am afraid that to send herto another boarding school would be to have the same thing occur, andyet she must have some education. She cares for nothing save her musicand the outdoors and was perfectly well and happy when she was withmother and me last summer."A moment the three girls remained silent, then Sally answered."If you and Tante think it wise and Alice and Vera and Aunt Patricia arewilling, why not have Elce come and live with us this winter?  I knowshe would rather be with you, Bettina, but if you are to be introducedinto society in Washington, you will scarcely be able to give any timeto her.  Besides, your mother may not wish to have her.  Elce can go toschool in New York and I’ll look after her otherwise. Perhaps this isnot the best thing for her, but it is the only solution I can suggest.She won’t be so homesick with us as at boarding school and she will havegreater freedom, then I shall like to feel that I am doing somethinguseful.""Good gracious, Sally, isn’t making a home for Alice and me beinguseful?" Vera remonstrated.  "I am sorry if I seemed cross a few momentsago; this was largely because you were in the right and Alice and I didnot enjoy our position."Before any one could reply there was a knock at the door and anothergirl entered."Mrs. Burton says that luncheon is ready if you will be kind enough tocome in. I am going to ask you not to stay long afterwards; Mrs. Burtonwould not mention it I am sure, but she is supposed to lie down everyafternoon for a short rest."As the four Camp Fire girls followed Juliet Temple out of the room,Sally managed to whisper to Bettina:"What is there about Juliet Temple that is so annoying?  That littlespeech she just made is the kind of thing that makes me especiallyangry, as if she were far more intimate with Tante and more devoted toher welfare than any of her Camp Fire girls?  I suppose she is devotedto her and certainly she makes herself useful and yet I never feel sureof her.  In my opinion she represents one of the causes of AuntPatricia’s estrangement."Bettina shook her head."I feel a good deal as you do, Sally, although I am not even soconfident of the reason.  Sometimes I think you are a better judge ofcharacter than any of the rest of us, so if you have an opportunity thiswinter I wish you would study Juliet Temple and find out what you can.Is she really devoted to Tante, or is she only devoted to her for whatshe thinks she can gain?  Come, we must not keep luncheon waiting and Iwant you to see Elce.  Suppose we talk to her of your proposal."                              *CHAPTER IV*                           *NATURAL HISTORY*Mrs. Burton’s New York apartment was not large.In her present state of mind Bettina Graham was restless, so, as hermother had consented that she spend the week with her Camp Fireguardian, she devoted many hours each day to being out of doors and tosight seeing.She was never alone; one of her excuses was that Elce must be amused andnot allowed to be troublesome.  The little English girl, the daughter ofa Lancashire miner, who had been deserted by her father and in a waythrust upon the Camp Fire girls during a brief visit to Ireland, alwaysaccompanied her.Elce was not a trying companion when one wished to pursue one’s owntrain of thought.  She talked but little and seemed shy and notparticularly clever save for her extraordinary musical gift.  Not thatshe had any gift for the technique of music. One of Bettina’s puzzlesand disappointments was that so far the younger girl had failed to showany proper interest in the study of music.  Her talent seemedspontaneous and natural as a bird’s ability to sing and she seemed aslittle capable of acquiring musical knowledge.Undoubtedly a problem, Bettina believed that Elce was chiefly herproblem.  During the summer in "Merrie England," when the little girlhad been a maid of all work in their household, she first had becomeinterested in her and in return Elce, whom they then knew by theLancashire title of "Chitty," had given her a devotion, which sherevealed toward no one else.  Indeed, the younger girl appearedcuriously free from the ordinary affections and to be strangely shy, orself-contained.It was at Bettina’s request that her father had undertaken to pay forthe little girl’s education.  There had been no thought of making her amember of their household, save perhaps during certain holidays.With Marguerite Arnot the circumstances were different.  Marguerite wasolder and in spite of her difficult background of poverty and hardwork[*] was possessed of unusual beauty and charm.  Then at onceMarguerite had responded to her mother’s influence.  Indeed, Bettina,although recognizing the unreasonableness of her own attitude,frequently had to stifle pangs of something approaching jealousy at thesympathetic relation between them.[*] See "Camp Fire Girls in Glorious France."Marguerite was no longer shy save in a graceful and attractive fashion.If she played but an inconspicuous part in the social life nowsurrounding her, she had the French tact and resourcefulness.  It seemedto Bettina that, as her own difference of opinion with her mother hadgrown and developed, Marguerite was beginning to fill her place.  Injustice she could not criticize Marguerite for circumstances with whichshe had nothing to do, although not enjoying the idea that her motherwas turning to some one else for the sympathy and devotion which shouldhave been her own to give and to receive.This afternoon, wandering about the Natural History Museum with Elce,Bettina was not particularly intent upon the exhibitions, but insteadwas planning a letter which she contemplated writing home later in theevening, when Mrs. Burton had gone to the theater and she could bealone.She meant to surrender her own desire; nothing else appeared possible,but she also wished her family to appreciate that she believed she wasbeing treated unjustly and that she had the right to her own choice oflife.Reaching a secluded corner and discovering an unoccupied bench, Bettinasat down, suggesting that Elce wander about alone and come back for herlater.  They were on the floor devoted to the reproduction of wild birdsin their native haunts.  Since the collection was a rarely beautifulone, Bettina believed it would be of so great fascination as to keep theyounger girl occupied for some time.  Personally she was alreadyfatigued.  Moreover, she wished for an opportunity to think without thepossibility of being interrupted at any moment.After her original talk with her Camp Fire guardian she had not referredto the subject of their interview.  There was little reason why sheshould.  Definitely she understood that Mrs. Burton’s sympathy was withher mother and that she had but scant patience with her rebellionagainst what might appear to most girls as a singularly fortunate fate.Bettina was not only disappointed, but puzzled and aggrieved.  From anyone save her Camp Fire guardian she would have expected such a point ofview.  She herself was able to accept the fact that it was but naturalother people should consider an opportunity to enter Washington society,chaperoned by her mother and with her father’s prominent officialposition, to be the summit of any natural girl’s desire. Yet from herCamp Fire guardian Bettina had hoped for another viewpoint.  Had she notheard her oftentimes insist that every living human being must followhis or her own road, and that whether for good or ill she could havefollowed no career save the one she had chosen.The difference in their positions Bettina Graham had far too muchintelligence not to recognize.  She was not choosing the career of anartist and had revealed no exceptional gifts.  She merely wanted to giveher life in service to persons less fortunate than herself, rather thanwaste it, as she felt, in a society existence for which she had neitherliking nor taste.  There was nothing romantic nor inspiring in herdesire. Her mother and father were both convinced that such work shouldbe left to older women, or to girls who possessed neither her positionnor opportunities.So since the prop upon which unconsciously she had been leaning, Mrs.Burton’s approval and help, had failed her, Bettina decided to make nofurther protest for the present.  Later she must convince her familythat her desire was not a whim, a moment’s caprice, the influence of astronger personality, which would vanish when other interests becamemore absorbing.Suddenly Bettina got up, realizing that the room in which she was seatedwas growing surprisingly dark and that a guard was moving about,announcing that the hour for closing had arrived.Before leaving Bettina had first to find her companion.At the farther end of the room she observed that a small crowd hadformed, who seemed loath to depart.Drawing near, to her amazement she heard a number of beautiful, birdlikenotes with which she was familiar.Undisturbed by her audience, Elce was standing by a showcase filled withbirds from the northern part of England, birds which the little girl hadknown almost from babyhood, as she had spent the greater part of hertime in the woods.  To-day amid strange and different surroundings, withapparent unconsciousness, she was repeating such bird notes as she couldrecall.The crowd about her was amused and admiring.Bettina laid her hand on the younger girl’s shoulder."Elce, we must go at once, it is growing late.  And you must rememberyou are not in the woods, or you will have so large an audiencesurrounding us some day that we shall not be able to make our escape.You are an odd child!  I thought you were exceptionally shy and afraidof people, and now you do a surprising thing like this and appear not inthe least abashed."In farewell Elce was nodding to several persons who had been standingnear.  She appeared entirely unaware that her behavior had been unusual.Out in the street Bettina discovered that the darkness had not been duesolely to the lateness of the hour, but that a thunderstorm wasapproaching.A few moments she stood hesitating. The History Museum was on the westside of the city and uptown and she wished to reach the east side anddown town as promptly as possible.  By what method she could mostquickly accomplish this result she was not certain.  Holding tight toher companion’s hand Bettina made a hurried rush toward the Broadwaysubway.She had no umbrella and large drops of rain were descending.  Thedarkness was surprising and interesting.  Men and women stopped in theironward rush to look upward toward the sky, where the clouds weremagnificent.Then the rain became a downpour.  Still Bettina and Elce rushed on,scarcely seeing where they were going.A moment and Bettina found her horizon limited by an umbrella, whichmade a circular barrier directly in her path."Is it possible that people can meet by accident in New York City inthis way?  I do not see how you can remember us," she was saying thefollowing moment."Our meeting is not so surprising as you think; people who live in NewYork never see their acquaintances unexpectedly, while strangers alwaysdo.  I am taking it for granted that you are not a New Yorker. You willhave my umbrella, won’t you?"Bettina shook her head."No, I cannot do that, but if you will see us to the subway and saveElce from drowning in this rain, I shall be under a second obligation toyou.  We did find Mrs. Burton the other evening in the fashion yousuggested."Bettina was smiling, amused and entertained by her unexpected encounter.The rain was dripping from her hat, her hair blowing, her cloth skirtwhipped about her ankles."We are trying to reach Gramercy Square," she added, when they had setout, their companion vainly attempting to hold his umbrella above thetwo girls."Then I suggest you take the bus so as not to have to cross to theshuttle at Times Square at this rush hour.  You won’t think I intendbeing impertinent, because already I have discovered two things aboutyou. You are staying with Mrs. Richard Burton and apparently she livesin Gramercy Park. You see, you have an unfair advantage of me in onerespect, as you know that my name is Burton and I have no idea ofyours."Making no rejoinder, Bettina’s manner became perceptibly colder.  Shewas not an unconventional person and was beginning to fear that she haddisplayed too great friendliness in permitting herself to recognize anacquaintance whom she had met in so informal a fashion.Yet until this moment he had seemed unusually courteous.At her change of manner he turned and began talking to Elce, so thatBettina was able to look at him more attentively.She had only an indistinct impression of him as he stood in his owndoorway several evenings before, giving her the aid of his friendlyadvice.  Curious that she should be appealing to his friendliness sosoon again!  Now she saw that the young man had brown hair and eyes, wasa good deal taller than she, and that he had an expression of delightfulgaiety.  Unconsciously Bettina felt a slight sensation of envy.  Sheknew the copy of Donatello’s faun and there was something in hercompanion which suggested the famous statue.  His brown hair, wet by therain, curled in heavy clusters, his ears were slightly pointed, his faceglowed with health and humor."I am sorry if I have offended you," he added.  "For my own part, Inever have understood why human beings require so much formality inlearning to know one another.  I confess I have been struggling todiscover an acquaintance who knows your Mr. and Mrs. Burton ever sinceour accidental meeting the other evening.  No one seems able to help me.The only human being I know named Burton outside my own family is aCaptain Burton I saw in France.  He was engaged in Red Cross work overthere.  But I met him on the street after our return and I remember hetold me he was living in Washington."Bettina bit her lips to hide their smiling, not altogether displeased bythis information."We have reached Broadway, haven’t we?  I am so much obliged to you, ashere comes our bus.  It would be odd, wouldn’t it, if by chance weshould both know the same Captain Burton.  My Mr. Richard Burton was inFrance in the service of the Red Cross and did live in Washington for atime after his return to this country.  He does not use his title atpresent, since he has given up his Red Cross work, although many personscontinue to call him Captain Burton.  Of course there may have been anynumber of Captain Burtons in the army.  I have no idea that we canpossess any acquaintance in common.  Good-by and thank you."                              *CHAPTER V*                             *RENUNCIATION*At the door of Mrs. Burton’s private sitting-room, which was slightlyajar, hearing voices inside, Bettina paused. She had changed her wetoutdoor costume for a simple dinner dress, but did not wish to disturbany visitor, knowing that her Camp Fire guardian saw only intimatefriends at this hour and in this room.  The room in which Bettina wasstanding at present was the ordinary reception room.Mrs. Burton was speaking and an instant later Bettina caught the soundof her own name."I did not dream, my dear, that Bettina could be so selfish andunreasonable.  I confess I _am_ deeply disappointed in her! Save thatshe told me what she wished with her own lips, I could never havebelieved she could be so inconsiderate of you."Then a voice followed which surprised Bettina, although it was the onevoice with which she was more familiar than any other."But, Polly, perhaps you do not understand Bettina.  She never beforehas seemed either selfish or unreasonable.  And if she now appearsinconsiderate of me, the fault probably is mine.  Bettina should havehad a more serious-minded mother, one who would not have asked her towaste her gifts and her beautiful, generous nature in a societyexistence.  I have been talking with Anthony since Bettina came to you.He seems unusually severe and for the first time I can recall is annoyedwith his ’Slim Princess,’ the title he used to bestow on Bettina.Anthony declares that Bettina should wish to be with me beyond any otherpossible desire and that she particularly needs my influence.  This I amafraid is not true.  I have been struggling to make Anthony see, and youmust recognize this as an excuse for Bettina, Polly, dear, that her wishat present is merely an inheritance from Anthony.  For as long as I canremember Anthony has been working to better conditions for people whomhe considers less fortunate than himself.  This has kept him many yearsin political life, when often his own desire has been to retire.  NowBettina simply is longing to express the same ideal in the work that, asa young girl, she feels herself by nature fitted for.  I have beenstanding in her way, I am afraid the selfishness has been mine, althoughat first I was unable to see the situation in this light.  I am so proudof Bettina and so wanted her to be with me in order to introduce her tothe brilliant and charming friends Anthony and I have acquired in ouryears in Washington.""You are an angel, Betty!" Mrs. Burton responded.Her companion laughed, for the first time her voice revealing a happiertone."Polly, there is only one human being in this world possessed of fewerangelic attributes!  That person is your famous self. It is ridiculousand not in the least fair of you to be so critical of Bettina.  Ipresume you have forgotten that when you were a girl youdisappeared--was it for over a year?--from all of us who cared for you.At that time you deliberately set out to try your fortune in soreprehensible a career as the stage.  Now if Bettina had chosen soundesirable a profession as yours, I might be unhappy.  The work shewishes to do is constructive and unselfish.  I went to call on MissMerton, the friend Bettina made last summer who interested her in socialsettlement work.  She has a very different impression of Bettina fromthe one you seem to have acquired as her Camp Fire guardian.  She is aremarkable woman and I never wish to forget what she said to me.  Sheeven agreed that Bettina should remain this winter with me and do what Iplanned for her, yet she believes that Bettina has a wonderfulpersonality and unusual gifts and that one day she will do work that maybe of permanent value. Under the circumstances it is I who have failedBettina.  In the future she will remember and find it hard to forgiveme.""Mother!" there was a little rush as Bettina entered the room.  Aninstant after her arms were about her mother and her cheek restingagainst her beautiful soft hair."I have been playing eavesdropper outside the door for the past tenminutes and so heard Tante villify my character and your defence of me.She isn’t to be trusted, is she, dearest?"Bettina glanced toward her Camp Fire guardian.  There was a little flashof understanding between them.Immediately Mrs. Burton rose from her chair."I am going into my room to dress for dinner, Betty.  I don’t know whatBettina’s idea of you may be, but I am convinced that you areunreasonable and inconsiderate.  I have merely seen your side of thisquestion because of my affection for you.  In return you tell me that Ihave no true appreciation of your daughter and that I have chosen aprofession for which you feel not respect while Bettina’s choice isaltogether admirable."Mrs. Burton’s eyes were lowered and her cheeks flushed as she movedtoward her own door."Polly dear, I haven’t wounded you? Please don’t be angry with me, younever have been in all these years."There was no reply.  Bettina whispered, "Don’t mind Tante, mother.  Ithink she really intended to force you to defend me.  Certainly I amgrateful to her. Besides, she needs your criticism this winter, now herplay is such a success and she no longer has Aunt Patricia or her CampFire girls to keep her in order.  As for all those foolish, delightfulthings you said about me, I shall remember them always, although ofcourse they are not true.  When are you going home?  I want to go withyou, I mean to be the most popular debutante in Washington this winter.The other foolish dream of mine can wait."Mrs. Graham shook her head."No, Bettina, now I understand how you feel, I really don’t desire youto do anything except what you wish.  Don’t leave us, please, Polly, notfor a few moments, I want to talk to you.  You can’t be offended. MissMerton suggests that Bettina take some special courses in social workthis winter and that she come to her for practical experience in thework two or three times a week."I won’t be lonely, I’ll run over to New York frequently to see youboth.  And remember, Polly, that you promised me that you would come tome in the spring, no matter if your play is the greatest success in NewYork.  You assured Richard and me that you would not try your strengthby a too long engagement. Besides, you have never seen our ’House by theBlue Lagoon’.  Bettina and I have given the place this title.  It wasAnthony’s anniversary gift to me.  The house is on an island in the sea,but there is an arm of water that has cut its way into the land that isblue as the Bay of Naples.  You’ll bring as many of your Sunrise CampFire girls with you as you can induce to come. This shall be my rewardthat you and Bettina both care more for what you are pleased to callyour careers than for me. I shall try to persuade Aunt Patricia to joinus.  She must have relented by that time."Mrs. Burton shook her head."Never, dear!  But of course I am coming to you.  I lie awake at nightand dream of the happy time we shall have together when the winter’swork is past.  ’The Blue Lagoon’, the very name is magical."                              *CHAPTER VI*                            *THE BOX PARTY*The group of people entered the box nearest the stage a few momentsbefore the curtain was to ascend.In the effort to find places there was the usual brief confusion; in theend the youngest of the girls was seated in the chair next thefootlights, with two other girls in the adjoining chairs, the chaperonand a fourth girl behind them, while a little in the background werethree young men."Mother, do take the outside chair; I am afraid you will not be able tosee properly, Bettina Graham suggested."Besides, Mrs. Graham, we wish the handsomest member of our box party tooccupy the most conspicuous place."Betty Graham arose to change places with her daughter."Never mind, David, I am perfectly willing to allow you to talk toBettina rather than to me, without such arrant flattery which is not aptto make you popular.  Besides, as I have not seen Mrs. Burton’s new playand am deeply interested, I do not wish to be interrupted.  I am afraidyou young persons may wish to talk.""There will be little danger of conversation once the play is started,"a third voice interposed, "I have seen it three times and found it asabsorbing the last time as I did the first."Bettina Graham turned toward the speaker."I am glad you were able to come with us to-night, Mr. Burton.  Do youremember that you were the first person in New York to mention, ’A Tidein the Affairs’ to me? In any event, mother, you need not fear we shallbe guilty of such bad manners as to attempt to talk while theperformance is going on even if we dared.  It is odd that I don’t knowthe story of the play, but then I have done my best not to find out soas not to affect my pleasure."Dressed in a new evening gown of pale green chiffon, which had been hermother’s gift since her arrival in New York, with a silver girdle and afillet of silver wound about her fair hair, her cheeks flushed withexcitement, Bettina Graham had never been more beautiful.At least this was the impression she made upon two of the three youngmen who were members of the same party; the third was too absorbed inhis own train of thought and in his excitement over seeing Mrs. Burtonact for the first time to pay any particular attention to any one of thefour girls.  Such interest as Allan Drain had expressed had been forMrs. Graham, who was his especial friend.As Robert Burton had seen Bettina only four times before this evening,his opinion was hardly of the same critical value as David Hale’s, whomBettina had met and known intimately several years before in France.Robert Burton, however, had never made any effort to find out whyBettina Graham had attracted him since the first moment of theirunconventional meeting.  To analyze his own wishes had never been hishabit. Accepting her half laughing challenge, he straightway had gone tocall upon the Mr. Richard Burton, who was her host, and discovered himto be the Captain Burton he had known in France.Telling the story of his accidental meeting with Bettina he had asked tobe properly introduced and Captain Burton had been glad to agree.  Heknew something of Lieutenant Robert Burton’s war record and also thathis father was a prominent New York lawyer; but particularly he likedthe young fellow’s straightforward fashion of setting out to accomplishhis design.Twice in the past week Robert Burton had called to see Bettina and beenintroduced to her mother and Mrs. Burton.  This evening he had beeninvited to be a member of their theater party.  For the same pleasureDavid Hale had come from Washington."Some night you hope to be sitting in the theater like this, Allan, andhave Mrs. Burton produce your first play.  I wish you luck.  Suppose inthe spring you make us a visit at my ’House by the Blue Lagoon’. Mrs.Burton will be with me, resting, and perhaps we may be able to persuadeher to read the play you are working on this winter.  I shall alwaysfeel responsible for the loss of your poems,[*] although Mary Gilchristwas actually the guilty person," Mrs. Graham declared, leaning a littleback in her chair and turning her head to speak to the young man behindher.  "I still hope some day to make things up to you, or perhaps Mrs.Burton may."[*] See "Camp Fire Girls at Half Moon Lake."Allan Drain flushed.  He was a tall fellow with strong features andreddish gold hair which he wore fairly long.  A student of medicine, hewas in reality only interested in writing.  He had met the Sunrise CampFire girls, their guardian and Mrs. Graham during the past winter whichthey had spent in the Adirondacks."You have fully repaid me for any loss by your friendship," he answered,with a slight huskiness of voice.  "To hope that Polly O’Neill Burtonwill ever be interested in my poor efforts at play writing is too muchto expect, yet if it is possible I shall come for the visit with thegreatest pleasure. There is nothing I should so enjoy."A hush at this moment preceded the raising of the curtain.  Out of sightof the audience an orchestra began the strains of an Irish melody famoushalf a century ago.A suppressed quiver of excitement passed through the small group of CampFire girls.In her seat nearest the stage Sally Ashton bit her lips to hide theirtrembling, feeling her cheeks suddenly flame.  She had been scarcelyaware of the conversation going on about her, or that the eyes of anumber of persons in the audience had been admiringly turned toward her.She wore a dress of rose-colored net with no trimming save a broad satingirdle of the same shade.Vera and Alice Ashton were in white, Mrs. Graham in an amber satin witha string of topazes about her throat, her wonderful auburn hairexquisitely arranged, her skin of a beautiful warm clearness, was morelovely than the girl of years before.Waiting to see the curtain rise she was the Betty Ashton of long ago,who had been one of the first persons to believe in the genius of thegirl, Polly O’Neill, always her dearest friend."I have not seen Polly act for so long a time, Bettina, I am almost asexcited as if this was her début night.  Yet Polly is sure enough of herlaurels these days!" Mrs. Graham whispered.Then the curtain rose.The first scene disclosed a small cabin set on a green hillside with aminiature lake in front.A girl in a green skirt, a white blouse and a green velvet bodice isseen seated on the grass near the water.  She is slowly crooning a lovesong with the words scarcely audible.Finally becoming impatient, she rises and wanders about, a frown on herface, a pathetic droop to her slim figure."Mrs. Burton looks about sixteen, doesn’t she?  Younger than any one ofyou!" David Hale murmured.Bettina paid not the slightest attention to his remark, and scarcelyheard it, as at this moment a second figure entered the stage, a boy whois about to set forth on a journey; one recognizes this from his costumebefore any words are exchanged. He has come to say good-by.The first act is devoted to their farewell. One learns that the girl isto be left behind with an old aunt who has been her foster mother, whilethe boy goes to the United States to seek a fortune for them both."Mother," Bettina said softly when the curtain had fallen, "don’t youthink Tante makes the parting between herself and her lover too tragic?It seems to me perfectly natural and there is no special reason forbeing unhappy, yet just because of her gift for expressing emotion sheseems the most pathetic figure in the world as he goes away and leavesher."Mrs. Graham smiled and shook her head, but made no effort to conceal thetears in her eyes."Perhaps you are right, Bettina, I don’t know.  Polly did not believeyou Camp Fire girls would care for her play.  It begins in a moresentimental age than the present one.  Fifteen years elapse, remember,between the first and the second act. Perhaps the modern girl would notregard the separation from her lover so seriously; she has moreinterests, more occupations, and sometimes I wonder if love may not meanless to her; I am not sure."The girl whom Polly portrays is left utterly alone, save for the oldwoman, who, we have learned, is harsh and querulous. She has only herdream and her affection."Talking to Bettina alone, Mrs. Graham discovered that, as the applausedied away, the other members of the box party were listening to herlittle speech."I agree with Bettina," Alice Ashton interposed."See here, Mrs. Graham, if you believe in sentiment don’t look for itamong girls these days," Robert Burton protested.  "If you want to knowthe kind of impression that parting scene of Mrs. Burton’s inspires, askany one of the three fellows in your party to-night.  If I cared for agirl and was compelled to leave her for an indefinite length of time, Itell you I should expect her to feel as the heroine does in this play.If she didn’t feel that way, I would not believe in her love."Mrs. Graham arose."I’ll leave you to argue the point without me.  I want to speak to Mrs.Burton for a few moments and she asked that no one else come behind thescenes until the performance is over."Immediately David Hale slipped into the chair beside Bettina, whileRobert Burton moved forward to talk with Sally Ashton who seemed apartfrom the others. Allan Drain joined Alice and Vera."It cannot be possible, Bettina, that you are not returning toWashington to spend the winter," David Hale remarked in a low tone ofvoice.  "Your mother spoke of it to me and then said perhaps you wouldexplain to me yourself."Bettina flushed, as the subject was not an altogether happy one and shewas a little annoyed at its introduction at this instant."Why no, I believe not, anyhow not for some time.  A group of theSunrise Camp Fire girls has taken a little apartment together in NewYork and we are planning to work and study here.  We are not to be withour Camp Fire guardian.  In fact we are not even to have a chaperon withus permanently.  You remember Miss Patricia Lord; one is not apt toforget Miss Patricia.  She has a house near Boston and is to appear nowand then to see how we are getting on.  Alice Ashton and Sally, and VeraLagerloff made the plan for the winter originally and are allowing mylittle English Camp Fire girl and me to join them. I am to do somestudying, but what I shall like much more, I am to work in one of thesettlement houses on the East Side.  I shall try to organize new CampFire clubs, as I don’t believe there are many of them in thatneighborhood."David Hale stared at his companion incredulously."You cannot mean you prefer a winter of this kind to making your débutin Washington, where you would be invited everywhere!  I don’t supposeit occurs to you, or that it makes any difference, but I am bitterlydisappointed?""Oh, you will have mother and Marguerite Arnot who will more thancompensate for my absence.  You know I long have hated the prospect ofhaving to come out in society.  I am too serious, I suppose, although Irealize this is not an attractive trait of character.  But, David Hale,do you recall how much you used to talk to me of your ambitions for thefuture in the days we knew each other in France? Well, I don’t see why Iam not allowed an ambition of my own even if I am not gifted. I havealways been more interested in the Camp Fire organization than the otherSunrise Camp Fire girls.  Now I see an opportunity to enlarge itsinfluence along with other work I am undertaking.  Mother did notapprove at first, but she is an angel and has finally agreed.  You seeshe was once upon a time a Camp Fire girl herself."At Bettina’s indifference to his point of view David frowned."Well, your mother is right; the new girl is hard to understand, even ifone happens to belong to her generation; that is, hard for a fellow likeme!  I--"Bettina was not paying a great deal of attention.  In the alcove at thefront of the box Sally Ashton and Robert Burton were laughing andtalking together, Sally wearing her usual demure expression which couldchange to sudden gaiety.  Evidently her companion admired her.Her mother’s return to her place and David Hale’s vacating it,distracted Bettina’s attention; moreover, the bell was ringing toannounce the second act of the drama.Fifteen years have gone by, but now for the first time the traveler, whohad departed as a boy, is returning to the Irish village high up amongthe lakes and hills.The report has come back that he has become wealthy and the village ispreparing to welcome him.  Hovering on the outskirts of the crowd onediscovers the girl, no longer young, with whom he had parted many yearsbefore.  She has not heard from him in a decade.  Still she isinterested and anxious to know if he will remember her, or if by anychance he may still care a little.  She never has forgotten.  Somemisunderstanding may have divided them, which a few words, a touching ofthe hands, a meeting of the eyes may explain.The hero returns.  He has forgotten and even fails to recognize the girlwho represented his youthful romance, is shocked by the change in herwhen she recalls herself to his memory.At the close of the act she goes back to the little cabin and the lakeand the green hillside, where she has lived alone these ten years, theold aunt having died.The pathos of the years of waiting has departed.  The meeting in thevillage has ended an old illusion.In the third and last act the heroine has established herself in apicturesque little house in the town, where she has gathered about hermany friends.  She is witty and gay, her clothes are pretty andfashionable. In the lonely years she has read a great deal and hasinterested herself in politics. The friends and admirers she might havehad, save for her faithfulness to a memory, are discovered around her,among them the man, who so easily had forgotten his plighted word.  Inthe end he proposes a second time and is refused."Love has no value without faith and I have no faith in you;" with thisline the drama closes."The play is delightful and Polly reveals all her gifts of laughter andtears, nevertheless it leaves one dissatisfied," Mrs. Graham insisted,as she allowed Allan Drain to help her with her coat.  "Allan, in yournew play give us a happier ending.""My dear mother, what a sentimentalist you are!  I could not imagine amore delicious climax.  My sex is avenged!" Bettina replied.  "Come, letus go back behind the scenes and offer our congratulations!"[Illustration: "My Dear Mother, What a Sentimentalist You Are."]                             *CHAPTER VII*                            *THE APARTMENT*The sitting-room was scrupulously clean.  The Camp Fire candles,representing work, health and love were on the mantel, but unlighted; asmall fire was burning in the grate.At one side stood a tea table with the arrangements for tea-cups andsaucers, the tea kettle and alcohol lamp.  At the moment the room wasempty.Then a door swung open and a girl entered wearing a ceremonial Camp Firecostume, her strings of honor beads and insignia of the highest rank,but over her dress a blue apron which came up to her throat and down toher ankles.Her hair was carefully arranged, parted at one side and drawn smoothlydown, yet little tendrils of brown hair had escaped and her face waswarmly Hushed.Seating herself in a low chair she extended her feet toward the smallblaze."The girls are late this afternoon, just because there was a particularreason why they should be early," she remarked in a maternal tone ofvoice, a little absurd in view of her appearance.During the past few months Sally Ashton had been presiding over thesmall apartment in New York which sheltered a group of the Sunrise CampFire girls.Getting up, she now walked over toward the window.  In the distance onecould catch a glimpse of the Columbia College buildings and in anotherdirection the dome of the great, unfinished Cathedral.  The winterafternoon was clear and cold.Returning to her former place, after a glance at the clock, Sally drew aletter from the pocket of her blouse and began reading it.  This musthave been a second or third reading since the envelope had disappeared.Nevertheless, the letter plainly occasioned her no happiness, for shefrowned, bit her lips and looked as if only a severe determinationagainst any display of weakness saved her from tears."I have not heard from Dan Webster in a month.  Now he has written meexactly one page which says nothing at all except that he is so busy andso tired at the end of each day that any letter he could write wouldonly bore me.  He is kind enough to hope we may meet in the spring inthe ’House by the Blue Lagoon.’  And this when I was foolish enough tothink that Dan actually cared for me when we were together last winter!""I do wish I were not one of the persons who cares for only a fewpeople!  No one understands, or believes this of me, save Tante, and sheis too busy this winter to be disturbed by Camp Fire confidences, eventhough she remains our guardian.  I wonder if she will be here thisafternoon?  As for Dan, I suppose I must stop thinking of him in spiteof the fact that we are such old friends."There was a little sound of a key scraping in a lock.  Thrusting herletter inside her pocket, Sally arose hastily."Sally, are we first to return home?" Bettina Graham’s voice inquired."I was delayed at the Neighborhood House a quarter of an hour longerthan usual.  Then I had to make a special effort to persuade thechildren to allow Elce to come with me. We had been having a lecture onbirds and she attempting to reproduce certain of the bird sounds and toteach them to the other children.  I wish you had been with us.  Youhave not been lonely?"  Bettina observed an unaccustomed expression onthe other girl’s face.As if slightly annoyed by the suggestion, Sally shook her head."No, certainly not; I am never lonely, I have had everything arrangedfor our Camp Fire meeting and for tea afterwards for so long that I amtired waiting.""Very well, Elce and I will change into our Camp Fire costumes and bewith you in a few moments.  I am surprised Vera and Alice are so late!I hoped Tante and Juliet Temple would have arrived.  By the way, Sally,what do you think of admitting Juliet into our Sunrise Camp Fire?  Wehave known her so many months that I am convinced she and Tante mustboth expect it, although they have not said so definitely. If we have anopportunity before they arrive, suppose we discuss the question."Bettina Graham’s conversation had been continued from inside her ownbedroom, with the door opening into the sitting-room which adjoined it.In fact the six-room apartment the Sunrise Camp Fire girls were sharingfor the winter, was so built that the three bedrooms and kitchen openedinto a single large room.  This served as their dining-room,sitting-room and reception room.  A small room, apart from the others,Miss Patricia Lord’s room, could be used as a study the greater portionof the time, since Miss Patricia was rarely in New York.Only twice in the last few months had she appeared unexpectedly.Confessing herself as satisfied with the life the girls were leading andthe work they were accomplishing, almost immediately she had returned toher home near Boston, never at any time mentioning Mrs. Burton’s name,even to make an inquiry concerning her health.The little apartment was comfortable. There were no signs of the wealthand luxury with which in the past, during the periods when theirguardian was with them, Miss Patricia had surrounded the Sunrise CampFire.  This, Miss Patricia explained, was due to two reasons.  Theerection of a home for French war orphans in one of the devastatedregions of France was absorbing more of her capital than she hadanticipated; moreover, she wished the girls to live simply and to resistthe temptation of the worldliness of the city she professed to abhor.The front door of the little apartment now opened a second time.Carrying several books under her arm and a package in her hand, Veraentered."Sorry to have been delayed, Sally, but I had to go several placesbefore I could find the kind of cake you said you wished for tea.  Iwanted to help you get things ready; you seem to do so much more workthese days than the rest of us in spite of our classes and Bettina’ssocial settlement.""You are not the last, Vera.  Where is Alice?  I thought you would comehome together."Vera smiled; there was a unique quality in her appearance which made herinteresting always, even if she were handsome to only a few persons.  Inher large eyes with their heavy lashes, her wide mouth and irregularnose there was a charm of character and intelligence more marked thanconventional beauty."Alice and I said farewell half an hour ago and she was to hurry home.I saw her stop to speak to her cousin, Philip Stead, for a moment and Isuppose they have not been able to separate.  Dear me, I hoped thatAlice and I were to remain eternal friends without masculineinterference, but these last few weeks Alice is failing me! She insiststhat she is only friendly with Philip Stead because he is her cousin anda stranger in New York, and lonely.""Never mind, Vera, you may have me to take Alice’s place.  I shall neverdesert you.  I am through with all masculine friendships forever,besides their being through with me!" Sally Ashton returned, thinking ofthe letter she had just finished re-reading.  At the same time sheextended her hand for the package."Thanks for the cake, but I did find time to make the kind Tantespecially likes! However, we will manage to get through with both.  Yougirls are becoming so learned as college students that I try to cling tothe few useful feminine arts which represent my only talents.""And the greatest of us is Sally!" Bettina Graham exclaimed, coming intothe sitting-room, clad in her Camp Fire costume.  "There is Alice at thedoor. Suppose we light our candles and begin our Camp Fire meeting,while she slips into her Camp Fire dress.  Tante told us not to awaither arrival.  She is too uncertain of coming.  And besides I hope we mayhave an opportunity to discuss the addition of Juliet Temple to ourSunrise Camp Fire club.  We have had this in mind for some time.  Is itour duty to add to our old group now so many of the original group havevanished?  Juliet Temple has lived in the same house with us and is atpresent living with our Camp Fire guardian, so she seems the mostnatural person to invite."A few moments later, when the business had been disposed of, AliceAshton, continuing the subject Bettina had introduced, said slowly, withthe seriousness characteristic of her:"I feel as you girls do about Juliet Temple.  I never have really likedher, although it would be difficult to say why. Perhaps it is becauseshe has been so reticent about her past history and revealed so littleinterest in us.  I feel that she does not especially desire to become amember of our Sunrise Camp Fire.  She only wishes it because Tantewishes it and is our guardian.  Possibly you girls may not agree withme, but now and then I have been afraid that my own distrust is largelyjealousy.  Juliet seems to have been able to make herself useful toTante in ways none of us has succeeded in doing.  Of late she dependsupon her for a great variety of things."Sally Ashton smiled."Good old Alice, of course we realize that we are jealous of JulietTemple!  Are you actually only beginning to be conscious of the fact?Now I for one am in favor of asking her to become one of our Camp Firegirls for certain reasons I do not care to divulge at present.  As I ammore candid than the rest of you, besides having a less agreeabledisposition, I want to say frankly that I shall be glad when for anycause Juliet and Tante separate.  Aunt Patricia has always disliked herand believes she has interfered with their devoted relation. I think sheremains one of the reasons why Aunt Patricia refuses to be even friendlywith Tante, when she is eating her heart out with loneliness and hurtpride.  But goodness, there is the door bell and doubtless Juliet isoutside!  A reflection on our Camp Fire to be caught gossiping!  Now ifTante suggests our inviting Juliet Temple to join our Sunrise Camp Firegroup, and if Juliet wishes it and can pass the requisite tests, I seeno reason we can offer for not including her.  For a good many reasons Ithink it may be wiser to learn to know her better. Please put fresh woodon the fire, I’ll open the door."The following moment the Camp Fire guardian entered the room, followedby Sally Ashton, Juliet Temple and a third girl.                             *CHAPTER VIII*                              *THE ENIGMA*Half an hour after, seated at the tea table, Sally Ashton was presidingover the serving of tea.  She had agreed to relieve the Sunrise CampFire guardian of the responsibility in order that she might be able totalk more freely.A few feet away, surrounded by the other girls, Mrs. Burton wasoccasionally drinking her tea, but more frequently answering or askingquestions.  Her custom was to devote one afternoon each week to theceremonial meeting of the Sunrise Camp Fire.  Now and then her visitswere interrupted and until to-day she had not been present in severalweeks at one of the councils.Dressed in exquisite taste in olive green, trimmed in an odd, orientalembroidery of green and gold, her dark hair simply dressed, her healthentirely restored, the Camp Fire guardian appeared not more than tenyears older than the oldest of her group of girls."I can’t tell you how glad I am that you came directly to us, Gill,without even waiting to telegraph," she was saying at this instant,speaking to the third girl who had entered the little apartment with heronly a short time before.  She was in deep mourning."You will stay on here with us at least until you can make somearrangement you like better," Bettina Graham added, slipping her handinside her companion’s and looking at her with an expression of sympathyand affection.For the first time in their acquaintance Mary Gilchrist’s eyes filledwith tears."I knew no one else would be so kind, or give me such help, so, as soonafter my father’s death as I could arrange my affairs I started east.But I did write and gave the letter to one of the men on the place tomail.  We are several miles from a post-office and I wanted it to go atonce.  He must have forgotten, so the letter will probably arrive later."I have scarcely any relatives.  My father left the farm in Kansas tome.  Some day I shall go back and try to become a successful farmer, butwhen that time arrives I hope to take all the Sunrise Camp Fire homewith me.  At present I felt that I could not live on in the big emptyhouse alone, so I left one of our men in charge and came to you.  I knowI failed to live up to the ideals of our Camp Fire when we were togetherlast winter at Half Moon Lake, yet I believe you realize I shall try notto fail again.""My dear Gill," Sally announced from her place of honor at the teatable, "you have always taken the attitude that no one of us evercommitted a fault in our Camp Fire life together until you failed toconfess last winter to Allan Drain that accidentally you had thrown awaythe manuscripts of his poems.  You did confess finally so why not forgetthe whole occurrence!  Certainly you are to live here with us thiswinter and occupy the room with me; Vera and Alice are together andBettina and Elce, so I have been alone. Tante is so occupied with herwork you will be less lonely with us and Miss Patricia I know will bedelighted.""Nevertheless, Sally, don’t you think Gill had best be with me for a fewweeks, or a few months, until she has rested?" the Camp Fire guardianprotested glancing at the girl in whom the past few months had wroughtsuch changes.Gill’s former air of almost boyish strength and vigor had vanished.  Hercheeks were sunken, her eyes had lost their gaiety, even thecharacteristic light sprinkling of freckles, due to her constant outdoorlife, were gone.Many weeks Mary Gilchrist had nursed her father with a completeness ofdevotion that had left no opportunity for an hour away from him."No, certainly not, Tante; Gill will be a great deal better off herewith us.  I am sure she would be lonely with you; you are so busy thesedays and have so many strange people calling on you.  There would be noone with whom Gill could talk, or who would look after her as I shall.I believe she needs being taken care of for a time."Mrs. Burton glanced toward Sally, frowning."You forget, Sally, Juliet Temple lives with me, and Gill would not haveto be alone when I cannot be with her.  Juliet takes wonderfully goodcare of me and I am sure would enjoy transferring her services to someone who has a better right to them.  I am afraid I am growing lazy withJuliet looking after my business affairs, writing my notes and seeingthat I am punctual for my engagements.  In spite of my being a Camp Fireguardian and struggling to conquer all my faults of character in orderto be a proper example to you girls, I am afraid punctuality remains aneffort.  But Gill of course must do what she likes.  I only wish her torealize I want to have her, if she chooses to be with Juliet and me.Juliet is not a member of the Sunrise Camp Fire, but may be some day."The grating of a key in the front door lock prevented furtherconversation at the moment.Sally arose from the tea table."I wonder who that can be?  No one has a key to our apartment except ourown family and no one is away from home!"The instant later a familiar step was heard in the hall and then a tall,spare figure entered the sitting-room."Aunt Patricia Lord, who dreamed you were in New York and how glad weare to see you!  Come and sit down and let me give you your tea at once,I know it is tea you always wish after a journey!" Sally exclaimed,putting her arms about the elderly spinster and embracing her."Sure and I do, my dear," Miss Patricia agreed, relaxing into a mildIrish brogue, which with her was always a sign of especial satisfaction."And glad I am to arrive at a Camp Fire meeting.  Perhaps it was my dutyto have let you know of my coming, but of a sudden I grew so lonely Icould not wait to see what mischief you were up to at present.  If mylittle room is occupied I’ll go to a hotel to-night and come to see youto-morrow."Her usual sternness relaxed, Miss Patricia looked from one member of thelittle group to the other.  Suddenly her face stiffened and hardened.The Camp Fire guardian had risen and was moving toward her with bothhands outstretched in a lovely, pleading gesture."Dear Aunt Patricia, surely you will speak to me?  What have I done tooffend you so deeply?  Do you realize that you have not replied to oneof my letters or allowed me to see you since we parted at Half MoonLake?""I realize it perfectly, Polly, and I refuse to speak to no one.  How doyou do.  You may give my love to your husband.  Sally, if it is not toomuch trouble I prefer to go to my room and have my tea there.  Gill, isthat you?  Come and kiss me, I was sorry to hear of your loss."Miss Patricia was turning away when the Camp Fire guardian spoke asecond time."Don’t go, Aunt Patricia, on my account. I will leave at once.  Our CampFire meeting is over and the girls will wish to talk with you.  I wonderif you know how it hurts me for you to be unwilling to remain in thesame room with me?  Once I thought you cared for me--a little."Without replying the gaunt figure moved away, Sally following her.Bettina Graham put her arm about the younger woman."You are not to go, Tante, we will not allow it.  Aunt Patricia is tooabsurd and unkind!  It would be difficult to forgive her, if one did notappreciate that she is suffering more than any one else.  Besides, youpromised to recite for us before you left."Mrs. Burton made a swift gesture"Please release me from my promise, I don’t feel that I can just now.Aunt Patricia’s attitude toward me makes me more unhappy than any oneknows.  Juliet, I prefer to go home alone and I wish to walk.  Will youstay and talk to the girls about becoming a member of their Sunrise CampFire.  If they are willing and you will conform to the Camp Firerequirements I should like it very much."With Bettina’s assistance putting on her hat and coat, Mrs. Burtonlingered a moment longer."Will you really be disappointed if I do not recite for you?  I don’twish to be selfish and shall keep Aunt Patricia away from you only a fewmoments more."The other day I came across this poem written by an old friend of mine.I shall only repeat a part of it, I don’t suppose if Aunt Patricia is inher room that I shall annoy her.  I’ll speak quietly."If Mrs. Burton’s tone was low, her voice held the quality that no onewho heard it ever forgot.The little Camp Fire sitting-room was now in shadow with only the lightof the dying fire and the flickering candles.    "Be with us, Beauty, through the toil of life,      Through youth and through the everlasting years,    That we may live unwearied by the strife      Knowing the wisdom of laughter and tears.    "Be with us, Duty, while we seek the goal,      Honor and fame, courage and high desire,    Sister of Beauty, as the mortal soul      Kindles the body with her sacred fire."There was a moment of silence as Mrs. Burton ended.  Then with a wave ofher hand and a few words of farewell, she went quickly away.Immediately after Sally returned."I am sorry not to have been able to say good-by to Tante, but AuntPatricia kept me standing in the hall while she listened hungrily to herevery word.  She then shut me out of her room.  I never knew any one whowas behaving more foolishly, and I should tell her so, if I dared.""Juliet Temple, now that we have an opportunity, would you care todiscuss becoming a member of our Camp Fire?  We have never understoodwhether you really wished it."At Sally’s words the other girls resumed their positions on theirceremonial cushions, which left the one girl an outsider.  She remainedstanding, facing them."Won’t you please be seated," Bettina invited, acting as spokesman forher Camp Fire group which was her usual task."You know of course that our guardian desires you to become a member ofour Camp Fire and what her wish and influence mean, but the fact remainsthat you have never shown any interest in the organization or suggestedin any way that you would care to join us.  After spending severalmonths with us at Half Moon Lake you know something of our requirementsand our ideals.  Will you please be perfectly candid?"At Bettina’s request, Juliet Temple had not sat down.Instead she stood looking down at the six girls as if slightly amused byBettina’s speech.Never at any time in her memory had she cared for intimate girl friends.Never had she cared less for one than at the present time.  Among thegirls before her of varying tastes and temperaments not one attractedher."You are very kind and I am sure Mrs. Burton intends being equally soand yet I feel it best I should not become a member of your Sunrise CampFire.  You know nothing of my history, little of my disposition andtastes and I might prove entirely uncongenial to you.  I appreciate thatyou are inviting me, not on my account, but on Mrs. Burton’s and yet Iam none the less grateful.  There are certain obligations in the CampFire, certain promises I do not feel willing to make.  I am going to askone favor.  Please do not speak of this to Mrs. Burton; allow me toexplain my position to her.  She may be disappointed and her friendshipmeans a great deal to me, more than any one of you can realize.""Why can’t we realize it?  I think I do better than you imagine," SallyAshton returned, looking closely at the girl who had just finishedspeaking.  "I don’t mean to be unkind and naturally we don’t wish you tojoin our Camp Fire circle unless it would give you a great deal ofpleasure and be a help to you as well.  I do understand, however, thatyou wish to gain a great deal from your association with our Camp Fireguardian and to separate her from us as much as possible.  We are notreally so stupid as you consider us.  But there, I am extremely sorry tohave been rude to you, and Mrs. Burton would be angry," Sally confessed.Alice Ashton rose and slipped her arm through the other girl’s.It was dark outside and twilight in the little room."Will you forgive Sally?  No one of us agrees with her and come and seeus whenever you have time.  Then we shall learn to understand oneanother better and you may change your mind about our Camp Fire.""Sally, it was you who suggested that we invite Juliet Temple to joinour Camp Fire group.  I cannot understand your behavior," Bettina Grahamsaid reproachfully when the unwelcome visitor had disappeared.Sally looked uncommonly penitent."I wanted to ask her simply because I felt sure she would decline.  Shehas some reason for not desiring any of us to know her too intimately.I am sure I regret being rude to her.  Unexpectedly I seem to have lostmy temper.""Undoubtedly you did, Sally, and she was our guest," Bettina protested.She was interrupted by the re-entrance of Miss Patricia into the room.Vera switched on the electric light and Miss Patricia gave a sigh ofrelief."I am glad that girl has gone; I don’t trust her for some reason.  Butthere, I suppose I resent Polly’s affection and dependence upon her.  Itis very odd.  At first she appeared to have no force of character, butshe is cleverer than I gave her credit for; I sometimes fear she iscleverer than any one of us.  Without her being aware of it, from thefirst moment of their acquaintance she has flattered Polly, when Iemployed too much the other method. Well, I am glad she is apparently sodevoted to her interests.  Polly no longer has any sense of affection orof duty toward me."Bettina rose and placed her arm about the older woman, drawing her downinto the most comfortable chair."Nonsense, Aunt Patricia, nothing separates you from Tante save your ownobstinacy and self-will.  Forgive me, but I must say it.  Juliet Templeis only an excuse.  Tante has no special affection for her.  Juliet hasher own living to make and few friends, and Tante finds her fairlyuseful and wishes to be kind.  But she is devoted to you and yourunkindness to her is her one sorrow in her happy and successful winter.Certainly she deserves her success, after so long a sacrifice of hertime and talent to us.""We will not discuss my relation with Polly, Bettina.  Girls, changeyour costumes and let us go out for dinner.  It is too late to prepareanything at home."                              *CHAPTER IX*                     *THE HOUSE BY THE BLUE LAGOON*"It is enchanting, Betty.  How in the world did you and Anthony make thediscovery?""By accident, dear.  We were with some friends on a yacht sailing aboutin the bay, when afar off I spied this tiny island and asked if we mightanchor here for an hour and investigate."One could not see the house from the shore, but Anthony and I followedthe line of the lagoon until on an autumn afternoon we found it in itsdeserted splendor.  It is a theory of mine, Polly, that each one of uspossesses a house of dreams.  As soon as my eyes fell upon this, Irecognized it as mine.  But don’t let me tire you either with myenthusiasm, or by trying to make you see everything at once.  Were Iwise I should keep a fresh attraction for each day that I might have youwith me the longer."The two friends were walking about in an open space of lawn before ahouse built like an English manor house.  The house had fallen intopartial decay; on this spring day pale green tendrils of ivy climbed theold walls, in the eaves birds were building their nests, here and therebits of the stone were crumbling away."We shall never have the money to rebuild the place and have the houseappear as it must have a hundred years ago, but I am not altogethersorry.  When Anthony found the old place was for sale and the whole ofthe little island he told me that if we bought it I must never expectthis.  We only hope to keep it from further destruction.""You don’t mean that you actually own the whole of this island, Betty,all these magnificent trees, the blue lagoon, the shore line with itsview of the sea?  Let us walk down to the lagoon and rest for a fewmoments.  I am more tired than I realized after last night’s journey.As soon as it is warm enough I shall crawl into a small boat and anchormyself in the lagoon for days and nights, when you have grown weary ofmy society.  This might be known as a place of heavenly rest.  Insailing across to the island so late yesterday afternoon, I only had abrief glimpse of the lagoon, which cuts into the island from the baydoes it not, as if it were an arm reaching into the shore."Betty Graham nodded."Yes, the island is nearly a complete, circle.  One can start from abank of the lagoon, follow the shore line and return to the oppositebank.  Originally the lagoon was to form an anchorage for boats withouthaving to depend on the tides.  Once the channel was dug the water hasforced its way in until the lagoon has become surprisingly deep.  Youmust promise me to be careful, Polly.  I can well imagine your dreamingin your boat and being carried out into the bay and then on toward thesea.""Well, dear, would it be a bad way of ending things?  Yet I believe Iwould rather float into your blue lagoon from the sea than away from it.I wonder if the depth of the water makes it appear blue as the waters inthe Tropics?  Please tell the Camp Fire girls to be careful.  What amagical place to bring a lot of people together in!  I was sorry not tocome to you with the Camp Fire girls, but had to give a half dozen moreperformances of ’A Tide in the Affairs’, before my season ended.  It wasdifficult at best, Betty, dear, to close things up while the play was inthe height of its popularity.  I never could have managed save that youand Richard saw to it that in my original contract I was to be releasedfrom playing in the spring.  I am supposed to put the same play on nextfall, yet I really don’t wish to.  I was never enthusiastic over it.""I was not either, Polly, as I told you. Why not play something else?It was never big enough for you!""All very well, Betty Graham, but you know nothing of the difficulty ofdiscovering a worth-while play in accord with one’s personality ortalents.  The good fortune of a real play comes only once or twice in alifetime."Mrs. Graham hesitated."Polly, while you are here do me a favor. In a rash moment I told AllanDrain, our young poet-playwright, to bring the manuscript of his latesteffort and that if you were in a good humor you might permit him to readit to you.  There is no reason to believe his play would be any worsethan other plays one has seen.  The boy is very ambitious and I thinkclever and I have invited him for several weeks, so you will have achance to rest beforehand."Mrs. Burton stopped and frowned."Betty, dear, please don’t ask this of me. Of course if you make it afavor to you, I have no choice but to agree.  But I am so tired andshall never be rested in a few weeks.  Of course this is not the realtrouble.  You don’t know how disagreeable it is to have youthfulgeniuses read you their efforts and then be obliged to tell them thetruth about their work, or at least the truth as one sees it.  It hurtsthem horribly when you cannot admire what they have done and often theynever forgive you. Besides, I am a sympathetic person and really hatehaving to wound them.  As for your young playwright, Allan Drain, towhom you have taken an unaccountable fancy, I several times allowed himto read his efforts to me during the winter when we were shut up in themountains.[*]  I was not busy then and more amiable.  His work was onlyfairly good; really he did not reveal exceptional ability.  I am crossand tired now and it would only destroy the boy’s pleasure and mine tohave to disappoint him.  I cannot have him encouraged in the idea that Iwould ever consider one of his youthful effusions.  You are notdisappointed, are you?"[*] See "Camp Fire Girls at Half Moon Lake.""A little, Polly, but the main thing is that you must not be worried, orhave anything affect the pleasure of your first visit to me in ’TheHouse by the Blue Lagoon’.  I hope you won’t mind the young people."Mrs. Burton laughed."If you mean my Camp Fire girls, Betty, I regard the speech as tooimpossible to answer.  As for the youths whom you have asked toentertain them, or be entertained by them, I’ve an idea that no one ofthem will have any attention or time to spare for me.  Who is here?  Notcoming down to dinner last evening I am not sure of all the names thegirls poured into my ears.""Oh, only the girls’ special friends, Dan Webster, David Hale, AllanDrain of course, Philip Stead, Alice’s and Sally’s cousin, and RobertBurton.  Bettina surprised me by suggesting that I ask the young fellowwhom she met by accident in New York when she was searching for you.  Iwonder if she has seen a great deal of him in the past winter? Has shespoken of him to you?  He seems a pleasant chap and admires SallyAshton. Do you know, Polly, I have half an idea that David Hale is inlove with Bettina, and although she is absurdly young, now and then Ifeel that I would rather she return his affection and lead a woman’snatural existence than pursue this idea of social service that thewinter’s experience, which I hoped in a way might cure her, seems tohave deepened.  Anthony says David Hale has a brilliant future ahead ofhim."The two friends sat down on a low stone bench a few feet from thelagoon.  In the April sky small white clouds played at hide and seekupon the field of blue, reflected in the deeper blue of the water."And you would like Bettina, Betty dear, to repeat your own life, marrya famous man and be happy ever after?  Most parents seem to want theirchildren to repeat their lives, if they have been at all happy andsuccessful.  Yet how few of them ever do! Don’t set your heart on thisidea of Bettina and David.  She does not care for him.""Nonsense, Polly, how do you know!  I believe she likes him extremely.She used to write me of him from France.""Very well, I won’t argue the question. There is one person you haveleft out of your house party, I am afraid purposely, and for my sake Iwant you to relent.  You did not tell me that I might bring JulietTemple with me, and I need her.  Do you dislike her?  I never haveunderstood the situation; not one of my Camp Fire girls has ever made afriend of her, Aunt Patricia is violently prejudiced against her, onlyRichard and I are fond of her.  I can scarcely tell you how much shedoes for us both. She is extremely clever and of late not only has kepthouse for me, but attends to small business matters that are soannoying. She writes out all the checks for the tradespeople and merelybrings them to me to sign, and oh, I scarcely know what she does notattend to!  Richard is always congratulating himself at havingdiscovered and brought her to me at Half Moon Lake. The child does notmind doing what a maid would do when I am very tired or very busy,although of course I do not feel I should allow this.  I have no rightto ask you a favor, have I, Betty, having just refused the one you askedme?"Betty Graham put her arm about her companion whose frailty always gaveher a pang when the met again after any length of parting."Oh, have your Juliet Temple if you wish and are so dependent upon her.You know you can do anything you like so far as I am concerned.  Yet Ithink you are making a mistake to trust the girl to such an extent andcertainly you should not have her look after your business affairs.  Shemight be careless, and as you are extremely careless yourself, Polly,and Richard not much better, there might be unnecessary temptations. Ireally believe you both do need Aunt Patricia."Mrs. Burton shrugged her shoulders."You did _not_ succeed in inducing Aunt Patricia to make you the visitwhile I am here, did you?  I am sorry, although not surprised.  Richardwent to see her not long ago and she seemed rather pathetically pleased,made him stay in the house with her and would hardly allow him out ofher sight.  She refused, however, to forgive me for whatever imaginarywrong I have committed.  She says now that she had grown so old anddifficult that I returned to the stage largely in order to be rid of herand that she refuses to be any further burden upon me.  And this in viewof the fact that Aunt Patricia has taken care of me as if I were achild, has lavished her wealth and time and strength upon me and neverallowed me to do anything of any kind to repay her.  Well, I am throughwith making repeated efforts to have her forgive me, for what I am notsure.  Alice Ashton and Vera Lagerloff seem to have taken my place and Itrust she may find them more satisfying than she ever did me.  At notime do I remember Aunt Patricia’s approving of anything I ever thoughtor did.""Don’t talk as if you were a spoiled child, Polly; at any moment youneed Aunt Patricia she will come to you at once."Mrs. Burton shook her head."No, I shall never allow it, or accept any favor from her again.  I toldRichard this when he returned and said Aunt Patricia still declined tohave anything to do with me.  I asked him to write this to her, that Ishould not trouble her at any time in the future.  But about JulietTemple!  The child is alone in my New York apartment; Richard is out oftown on business for a few days, and I am afraid she is lonely. She hasno friends and no relatives except a brother, whom I am afraid, fromwhat she has told me, is not of much account.  She seems fond of him,however, and they come from this part of the country I believe; I am notsure just where.  As for trusting Juliet to attend to my businessaffairs, there is an especial reason why I wish her to appreciate that Ihave entire faith in her.  She gave me her confidence upon an occasionwhen there was no necessity for it and I have always believed in her.As far as money goes, Betty, I am not rich enough to be a temptation toanyone.  You know that Richard and I made some unfortunate investmentsafter our return from France and lost the small estate we had savedbetween us.  You did not know that other people were also involved andbecause Richard was one of the officers of the company, we both feelthat we want to pay back to them at least a portion of what they lost.I made a good deal of money last winter, but have kept only what we needfor our personal expenses until fall, when I start to work.""Oh, Polly, you are so quixotic and so unpractical!  Suppose you shouldfall ill again?  But there, forgive me, I should not have spoken of sucha possibility.  When we are both old and you have grown tired of beingfamous and admired, will you come here and live with me at my ’House bythe Blue Lagoon’?"Mrs. Burton laughed."Yes, Betty dear, I’ll hide somewhere in one of your secret passages,while you entertain house parties of distinguished persons fromWashington, or elsewhere--Senators, Ambassadors, even Congressmen.  Withall my love for my work, it is you who are admired and who care forsociety.  Small wonder Bettina was never able to keep up with you!  Herecomes Bettina with her shadows, Elce and the little girl she broughtfrom the settlement.  ’Ardelia in Arcady’!  Do you recall the old storyof the child who came from the city to the country and was expected tocare for it and did not?  It was very amusing.  Bettina’s latest protégéis a pathetic little figure, with her crutch and her city pallor, butshe feels dreadfully lost on your desert island amid all this beauty andromance.  She is a little daughter of the tenement!  I believe I canunderstand her better than you or Bettina.""Princess, what are our visitors doing? Polly and I ran away for anhour’s quiet talk.  She is to learn to love our place nearly as much asI do," Mrs. Graham exclaimed.Bettina Graham came nearer.  She looked grave and sweet, although alittle smile showed at the corners of her lips."Oh, they are perfectly well entertained without us, dear, and I thoughtMaida and Elce needed my society for a little while."We have small hope of seeing much of you and Tante for a few days untilyou have grown accustomed to the wholly new experience of being witheach other.  You are worse than lovers."Actually, mother, your house party has accepted your suggestion and hasset to work to make you a garden, a new garden where the old one hasbeen this hundred or more years.  It is a charming idea!  We are toleave such shrubs and roses as will bloom.  David Hale and Dan Websterhave taken charge and say we are to work two hours every morning, beforewe are allowed to do anything else--boat, or bathe, or fish, or sail.It is to be a memory or a friendship garden, although we intend to finda prettier and more original title.  Anyhow, the garden is tocommemorate our first Camp Fire house party by the blue lagoon. Isn’tthe place exquisite, Tante?  Sitting here by the lagoon can one imaginethe poverty and sorrow I see every day in my settlement work, or such anexperience as Maida’s, whose father is responsible for her lameness?Forgive me, mother, I promised myself not to speak of these things, oreven to think of them while I am on your enchanted island.""This is not my kingdom, Princess, but yours when you will come home toit, yours and Polly’s.  It is only you people who work for others whodeserve enchanted islands.  I am delighted to hear about my new gardenand my gardeners.  We must send for all the flowers we can think of, asApril is the perfect month for planting.  Do you know I always havewanted a blue garden, I suppose because I have loved blue more than anycolor all my life and wondered why there were so few blue flowers.Suppose we plant only blue flowers here by the blue lagoon."You stay here, dear, I must go and see about luncheon.  Bring Pollyback with you.  I don’t want her to go off alone to explore our islandand am afraid she has it in mind.  One always has the feeling that shewill slip away from one somehow.""No such good fortune, Betty!  Bettina, while I think of it, mother hasagreed to let me have Juliet Temple here with me, although I am afraidyou girls do not want her.  I wish you would not be so prejudiced andunfair.  She will not be troublesome or intrude on you I am sure, butyou will try and see that she has an agreeable time.""Naturally, Tante, I am not apt to be rude to a guest and will do what Ican. Your Camp Fire girls hoped you would be willing to allow us to bewith you and do whatever you wished to have done for the little time youare here.  If you cannot get on without Juliet Temple, we shall ofcourse be friendly to her.  She has been unfriendly, we never have.""You are cross already, Bettina.  Will you speak to Sally?  ObviouslySally does not like Juliet, and Sally has a habit of frankness.  Tellher I shall be hurt and displeased if she is not especially kind.  Nowlet us talk of something else.  Ask Elce and your little lame girl tocome and sit by us."Elce, if you will sing for me some day all alone here by the bluelagoon, I’ll recite a poem to you about these old trees:    "When by the spring’s enchanting blue,    You trace your slender leaves and few,    Then do I wish myself re-born    To lands of hope, to lands of morn.    "And when your wear your rich attire,    Your autumn garments touched with fire,    I want again that ardent soul    That dared the race and dreamed the goal.    "But, oh, when leafless dark and high,    You rise against this winter’s sky,    I hear God’s word: "Stand still and see    How fair is mine austerity."Come, let us go back to the house, it must be nearly lunch time."                              *CHAPTER X*                              *ONE NIGHT*The grounds surrounding the old house were hung with Chinese lanterns.Walking about in the semi-darkness were groups of figures, ordinarilytwo in number.In the big drawing-room the music had just ceased, while the musicianswere having their supper and a brief rest.  Senator and Mrs. Graham weregiving an informal dance for their daughter and house party.Other guests had crossed over from the mainland, which was not an hour’sjourney in a motor boat or one of the small steamboats that carried mailand provisions, but was apt to be a long crossing in the uncertainty ofa sail, and almost impossible in a rowboat, unless one were a singularlystrong oarsman.There were half a dozen young officers from the fort and as many girlsfrom a fashionable hotel on the Virginia coast."Sally, it has been utterly impossible to have a word with you, to saynothing of a dance!  A fellow likes a girl to be a good dancer, but notso good that he never has a chance with her.  I must say that you andRobert Burton look pretty well together, he dances almost as well as youdo and makes me feel awkward and clumsy. Somehow I am surprised that youare such a fine dancer, Sally, when you don’t like other kinds ofexercise," Dan Webster concluded."If you are going to start our walk, Dan, enumerating my faults, I donot intend to go one step with you, although it is one of your favoriteamusements.  All very well we have known each other a long time, but Ido not think that a sufficient excuse."Arm in arm Sally Ashton and Dan Webster were sauntering away from theveranda toward a more deserted portion of the lawn.Sally spoke in the demure tone and manner, which oftentimes disturbedher companion, since he was not able to guess whether she were inearnest or amusing herself at his expense."Nonsense, Sally, I could not enumerate your faults for any length oftime!  I only think you possess two or three faults, and sometimes, notoften, I have been known to speak of them."At present I cannot imagine what I have said or done to annoy you,unless following you around all evening and trying to induce you to paysome slight attention to me has troubled you.  In that case of course infuture I shall leave you alone."I joined the house party when it was extremely difficult for me to bespared from the farm, chiefly in order to see you.  I have seen less ofyou than any one else and at times this has not looked like an accident.If this is true will you be kind enough to be frank."Sally gave her companion’s arm a slight squeeze."Don’t be such a bear, Dan.  You always were a surly small boy when youwere annoyed in the days we used to play together."There is a hammock under the linden trees; let us sit down if you donot mind, I am a little tired after dancing so long. You know perfectlywell how much engaged we all have been since our arrival at the island.You reproach me for not deliberately separating myself from the others,when I have not said a single word to you for failing to write me a halfdozen letters all during the past winter.  I suppose you were writing toso many other persons!""No such thing, Sally.  As you well know, I simply can’t write lettersthat are worth a row of pins; they never seem to express what I think orfeel, and I am afraid of boring you.  If I speak of something now, youwon’t consider that I intend criticizing you; I suppose I do keep moreof a watch on you than on other girls, because I am more interested.Twice lately you have deserted every one in the house party and gone offsomewhere to some mysterious part of the island alone.  Please don’trepeat this.  You see it does not look well and worries me.  The islandis fairly deserted, but there are spots where fishing boats might land,or people out for a holiday. If you feel you want to be alone, I canfollow you and promise not to interfere in any way."In a hammock swung by chains in a small grove of linden trees, Dan andSally sat down.The April night was surprisingly warm with a breath of summer that comesnow and then in the southern spring.  The tiny blooms of the trees madea shower of fragrant gold about them.  From beyond blew the salt breathof the sea.Sally remained quiet a moment before replying."You are very kind, Dan, I am sorry you have noticed that I have goneaway once or twice alone.  I have not been in the slightest danger andhad a definite reason for going.  I can’t tell you what this is,probably it is not of any consequence, yet I must ask you under nocircumstances to follow me.""And I decline to make you such a promise, Sally, in fact I forbid yourwandering about the island alone.  If there is any mystery connectedwith your behavior, I thought you hated mysteries; in fact you assuredme that after your experience in caring for Lieutenant Fleury[*] inFrance, you were through with all secrecy forever!"[*] See "Camp Fire Girls in Glorious France.""There is no especial mystery in what I am interested in at present,Dan, at least nothing of importance.  Indeed, I am indulging in a whim,and as I am doing no one any harm I think I have the right. Perhaps Ishall not keep up my quest very long, only a few days until I make adiscovery," she added, feeling a stiffening of the figure beside her andappreciating, without having to behold the firm line of the lips.  Sheand Dan Webster had known each other so many years that there weretraits of his character she thoroughly understood."Besides," she protested, as an afterthought, "you have not the faintestright to forbid my doing anything I wish.""No, I suppose not," Dan returned, not looking toward Sally, but at theold house a short distance away, shadowy and stately under the stars."I presume I never shall have that right, even if you come to care forme some day as I hope you may care. Indeed, I almost believed you wouldwhen we parted last, but now I see what an ass I was.  I told you then Iwould not speak of this until you were older and I had made something ofmyself.  I never will amount to much, Sally, I see that pretty plainlyhere in comparison with only a small group of other fellows.  David Haleis the real thing, brilliant and ambitious and knows what an educatedman should know. Allan Drain is the artist with his writing of poetryand plays.  He talks in a way that makes you sit up now and then, evenwhen you do not agree with him or get all he means.  Philip Stead is astudent and will end by being a professor.  Robert Burton I don’tunderstand so well, although he has something none of the rest of ushave, not just good looks and good manners, while I--well, Sally, I onlywant to make things grow, to watch the wheat ripen and turn gold, thecows on the old New Hampshire hillsides feeding beside their calves.The farm is double the size it was once and I intend it shall be fourtimes larger.  I mean to gather men about me interested in makingagriculture what it should be and farmers’ lives the most independentand worth while. When I am rich, rich as ever I am apt to be, I plan tofound an agricultural school and to give the land and the benefit of theexperience I have had and my father and grandfather before me.  Don’tthink I fail to realize how dull this sounds; when I speak of it mostpeople yawn or struggle to appear polite and change the subject.  Idon’t care, it is only how you feel, Sally, that matters.  You have hadso much experience and this past winter in New York has changed you moreeven than the years abroad.  Once upon a time you would have granted thesmall favor I just asked you, now you won’t even do this for me.""Dan, you _are_ stupid; I wonder sometimes if I shall ever make youunderstand how dull you are on _one_ particular subject. At present I’drather you would not know. As for doing the favor you asked, I won’tbecause I have a reason which I believe justifies my refusing.  You knowhow obstinate I am, everybody who knows me is of the same opinion on thesubject.  Why not try to trust me?  As to the effect the past winter hashad, I do feel older and more self-reliant.  Mary Gilchrist was illalmost the entire winter and I had the care of her, then I was thehousekeeper for the Camp Fire girls.  Never apologize to me for _your_stupidity, Dan, dear, which I don’t think is apparent to any one saveyou. Among the Sunrise Camp Fire, no one even thinks of disputing therecognized fact that I am the least clever of all the girls.  I do noteven mind especially.  I find life interesting and after all one cannotmake oneself over altogether!"[Illustration: "I Wonder if I Shall Ever Make You Understand How DullYou Are on One Particular Subject."]For the first time in the interview Dan laughed, a good natured, boyishlaugh, full of strength and sweetness."If you are stupid, Sally, then I am proud to be in the same companywith you.  I should like to know what Tante thinks of you!  You may beless interested in books and more in human beings."In the half darkness Sally smiled.A lantern in one of the trees overhead swung and tilted so that thelight shone down on her face.Sally wore her rose-colored net and had a scarf of the same rose colorabout her shoulders.  Tucked under her brown coil of hair in the fashionof the women who had danced in this old southern house and paraded itslawns a century ago, was a pink rose, a little crumpled now and faded.Dan put up his hand and touched the rose gently, one could scarcely havethought there could be such gentleness in the strong fingers."Give me your rose, please, Sally; I don’t know just why I want it, butI do. I never could see much sense in fellows wanting to hold on tothings like this before."Sally jumped up suddenly and the little rose fell to the ground."Please be careful, Dan, here comes Tante and she may see you.  I don’tknow what she would think."The girl’s movement arrested Mrs. Burton’s attention.She was walking about in the silver night with Senator Graham, whom shehad known many years before as a poor boy, with little education, withnearly every handicap, lack of family, of influence and position.  Hewas now one of the distinguished men of the country."Is that you, Sally and Dan?  May I speak to you?  Anthony, go back toBetty and see that she rests for a few moments, she is the most tirelesshostess in the world! Sally and Dan will escort me to the house if I amnot able to walk the few yards alone. And will you tell Betty that if Idisappear I have gone up to my own room.  I shall listen to the musicuntil the dancing ends and then go to bed.  The boat goes back atmidnight, so I suppose the dancing can’t last much longer."Mrs. Burton sat down in the hammock between Sally and Dan, slipping ahand into each of theirs.Dan Webster was her nephew, the son of her twin sister and of the manwho had been under the impression that he cared for her before hisdiscovery that they were entirely unsuited, and that the sister, who washer opposite in everything save her personal appearance, was the reallove of his life.[*][*] See "Camp Fire Girls Amid the Snows."Sally Ashton was the daughter of two friends of her girlhood.With no children of her own, Mrs. Burton cherished a deep affection forSally and for Dan, but for different reasons.  One reason was thesame--she had a feeling of dependence upon them both.  Dan was nearlylike her son.  Sally Ashton, well, most people who knew Sally intimatelydid depend upon her, without being able to explain why."Children, do a favor for me.  You’ll hate it, but Sally has promised.Come with me and find Juliet Temple and see if she is having a goodtime.  If she is not you’ll dance with her, Dan, and make yourselfagreeable?  Juliet has not been here so long as the rest of you and I amafraid feels lonely.  She seems to spend most of her time alone.  Youlike her well enough, don’t you, Dan?""Of course, Tante, she seems all right, strikes me as clever.  She isn’tabout much; when she is, it never occurred to me that she would beinterested in me.  If you are fond of her I’ll do my best."Dan put his arm about Mrs. Burton’s waist."You are coming to the farm to be with us for a time when you finishyour visit to the ’House by the Blue Lagoon’?  Mother will never forgiveyou and will perish of jealousy if you do not.  She does not enjoy theidea that you are fonder of Aunt Betty than of your own twin sister.  Weboth wish you would give up that plagued stage and you and Uncle Richardlive with us until you are a little less like a wraith.  But see here,Tante, I’ll strike a bargain with you.  Sally will have nothing to dowith me at present.  If you will promise to bring her with you to thefarm for a visit this summer I shall devote myself while I am here toyour Juliet Temple, that is, if she will allow it."Mrs. Burton smiled."Dan, I suppose you know you are like your father, only nicer.  I don’twant you to be so attentive as to deceive Juliet, only to see that shehas a good time.  I have been looking for her for the past hour and shedoes not seem to have danced with any one.""Juliet may have gone for a walk, Tante, I think I saw her a short timeago.  I have not forgotten that you said you wished me to have her inmind," Sally remarked.  In her speech, or in her manner there wasnothing that was unusual, nevertheless both Dan and the Camp Fireguardian were aware of bewilderment."Do you mind walking about with me for a few moments and trying to findher?  Of course I know _you do_ mind, but will you in any case?" Mrs.Burton pleaded."I am a tiresome woman, Dan, to have interrupted your talk with Sally,but I will make it up to you some day.  Sally is difficult, but worththe effort.  You must promise me that you will say nothing to her andeven feel nothing for the next few years, then I will be your warmestally," Mrs. Burton whispered, walking close beside the tall fellow whotowered nearly a foot above her, while Sally moved along the path infront of them, a figure of rose and silver.Half an hour later the Camp Fire guardian was sitting in her room halfreading, half listening to the music and voices in the house and gardenbeneath her open windows.She was in her dressing gown and her hair was unbound.  The big room wasin shadow, save where the light fell about her reading-lamp.  One couldsee the tall ceilings, the high windows, the few pieces of old Englishfurniture, brought to America by the early Virginia settlers.There was a faint noise of a door being softly pushed open in theadjoining room."Juliet, is that you?" Mrs. Burton inquired.  "Are you tired of thedance and on your way to bed as I am?  I looked for you before I came upand could not find you, I suppose you were somewhere in the grounds.""Yes, I was.  Is there anything I can do for you?  Is your bed turneddown?" the girl answered.Mrs. Burton nodded."I believe so, but you must be more tired than I am, so please don’ttrouble about me to-night.  You are too considerate of me altogether.There is some business in the morning I should like to have you help mewith for an hour or more.  My accounts seemed to have become tangled inthe most absurd fashion and I should like to have them straightened outbefore Captain Burton joins us.  You are a good mathematician, Juliet,and neither of us are.  Now go to bed."The girl lingered."I want to say something first, perhaps this is not the proper occasion,but it does not make much difference.  Since I came to live with you,Mrs. Burton, I have tried to make myself useful, but I don’t think Ihave ever spoken of the fact that I have grown to be very fond of you.Oh, I realize this is not an unusual experience so far as you areconcerned, most of your friends and family seem to adore you, but it isunusual with me.  I never have cared for any one, except my brother.  Itold you that he and I were orphans and that he was younger. Until hejoined the army he gave me a good deal of trouble, but has been bettersince. I persuaded him to continue as an enlisted man and to try to passthe examinations for an appointment as an officer later.""A wise idea, Juliet.  Is there anything I can do to help you?  I am nota very influential person, but would do anything possible.""No, no, there is nothing," the girl returned hastily; "I am going tobed in a moment."The older woman continued her reading, a little disturbed by the factthat her companion would not retire and leave her alone. She likedJuliet Temple and was grateful and appreciative, but never had felt forher the spontaneous affection she had for her group of Sunrise Camp Firegirls.  This fact did not trouble her, she never had cared equally forall the girls associated with her in the most intimate fashion duringthe past few years.  Human nature makes its inevitable selections.  Atthe moment not wishing to be unsympathetic she was hoping that hercompanion would make no special demand upon her at this hour of thenight when they were both weary.  Sentimentality in their relations theSunrise Camp Fire girls never had indulged in and she never hadencouraged."Mrs. Burton, I hate to speak of this, but I must.  Do you think you cangive me a larger salary for the work I am doing for you.  I need it agreat deal."A short silence, then Mrs. Burton laid down her book and flushed."Juliet, is this what you have been trying to say?  I am glad you havebeen frank, even though I must refuse your request, Please don’t think Iam not sorry, but you understand Captain Burton’s and my circumstancesat present almost as well as we do.  You know we are trying to pay adebt that we believe we owe.  We enjoy having you live with us, you havebeen the greatest aid and pleasure, but the fact is that you really havebeen spoiling me, as it is not actually essential that I should haveyou. I could manage to keep house with dear old Elspeth, who came to NewYork to be with me from Half Moon Lake, and who could probably lookafter things as well as you or I.  I can even attend to my tiresomeletters and business if I must.  I have told you several times, dear,that I thought you were being wasted upon me.  When I go back to town Ican find you a much better position with a good deal larger salary.  Ican do this at once if you like."The girl shook her head."No, I told you I did not wish this, perhaps it does not matter, I maynot need the money after all.""Don’t decide at once, Juliet.  Good night. Are you having a happy timehere?  I wish you liked the Camp Fire girls better.  You would behappier with more friends.""Oh, the girls are agreeable enough, the fault is mine.  Mrs. Burton, doyou think it possible to be truly fond of any one and yet to do thatperson an unkindness, a serious unkindness, not a trivial one?"Mrs. Burton closed her book."My dear Juliet, what are you talking about?  Of course it is possible,almost anything is possible with human beings, yet it is scarcely thekind of affection one would care to receive.  But now really I want togo to sleep, the music has ceased downstairs and I hear voices infarewell.  The dance must be over."                              *CHAPTER XI*                           *THE SAME EVENING*Reluctantly Mary Gilchrist had joined the house party at the "House bythe Blue Lagoon".After her arrival in New York for the first time in her life she hadbeen ill, nothing serious at first, merely a languor and depressionwhich she could not shake off, and then a fever which persisted for sometime in spite of every care and devotion.Never a day passed that she did not say either aloud or to herself thatshe would have felt scant interest in her own recovery had she not beenliving with the Camp Fire girls.After her father’s death she was almost entirely alone, with norelatives save distant cousins and separated from the friends of heryouth by the years in France.  Always she and her father had led afairly isolated existence on their big thousand-acre wheat farm.  Herown love of the outdoors, of boyish amusements and of the work of theestate, together with her father’s companionship, had been sufficient.Shut up in the small New York apartment, ill and grieving,notwithstanding, the affection and attention lavished upon her, forseveral months Gill had found life difficult.With the arrival of the cold New York spring she approached a betterframe of mind, but still was without desire to join in any gaiety.Her one expressed wish was to be allowed to remain alone in theapartment while the other girls went for the visit to the "House by theBlue Lagoon".This they positively refused to consider.As she had been Sally’s especial charge, Sally announced that she didnot believe Gill sufficiently strong to make the journey or to be in thesociety of so many persons, so she had concluded to stay on in New Yorkwith her.  Sally was not easily dissuaded from a decision, so partly toavoid this sacrifice, partly because she did not wish to be separatedfrom her friends and was interested in Bettina Graham’s home, Gillfinally agreed to accompany them.The stipulation was that she was to be allowed to be alone as much asshe liked and to take no part in any of the entertainments, unless shefelt the inclination. No one would try to persuade her to do anythingagainst her wish.On this evening of the dance, Gill had been undecided whether or not toleave her own room.  At length the desire to see the beautiful old houselighted and filled with spring flowers and the girls in their partydresses brought her down to the drawing room.  Here she was introducedto a number of the guests and enjoyed talking to them, but positivelyrefused to dance.  And no one insisted beyond the ordinary demands ofcourtesy, as her black dress offered a sufficient explanation.Gill was not in deep mourning; her dress was of sheer black muslin, cutlow in the neck, with a narrow edging of black net.She no longer wore her hair bobbed in the old, half boyish fashion, butdressed as simply as possible in a knot at the back of her head.The small claim she possessed to good looks, Gill believed had vanishedaltogether and for all times.  Her color was gone and her animation andshe had depended upon both.Yet to Allan Drain, who found himself glancing toward her with interestseveral times during the evening, she possessed an attraction he had notbeen aware of in their acquaintance at Half Moon Lake.  There was asofter and gentler atmosphere about her.  Her pallor, in contrast withthe red-brown hair and eyes, had its own beauty.Toward the latter part of the evening, observing that Gill was so whitethat she appeared ill, Allan crossed the room to the chair where she wassitting alone at the moment."Won’t you come out of doors with me for a little while, Miss Gilchrist.I believe you will like it better than indoors and I know I shall."Then, as Gill hesitated."Please come, I have not had an opportunity to talk to you alone sinceour arrival. I want to tell you that I think I was a good deal of a boorin refusing to say I forgave you last winter when you confessed that byaccident you had burned up the manuscripts of my poems.  After Ireturned home I discovered copies of a number of them stored away in oddplaces.  I am obliged to confess they seemed so utterly no account thatyou did me a favor by destroying them before they could be read by anyone."Gill shook her head."You are kind, but I don’t in the least believe you.  I told you thenand I still feel that I would rather you would not forgive me.  I haveno idea of forgiving myself.""Is it too far, shall we walk down to the lagoon?  I have not seen it atnight."Allan picked up a white shawl which some one had left on the veranda."No, it is not far, but it is probably cold down there, so put thisaround you.  Isn’t this place a marvel?  Any one who could not writepoetry here, or at least dream it, could nowhere on earth.  Do you knowthe story of the house and the island and the blue lagoon?  I have mademyself a nuisance trying to find out.""No, not as much as I should like to hear," Gill answered, placing theshawl about her shoulders in an obedient fashion."Originally the island was given by a special grant from the Britishking to an Irishman named Bryan O’Bannon, who had fought gallantly inhis service during one of the innumerable wars.  He appears to have beenunlike most Irishmen and a man of wealth, or else he married wealth,because his wife was one of the sisters of the great Lord Fairfax ofVirginia."They built this place and lived here like royalty, with hundreds ofcolored servants I suppose.  There is no special story of a tragedyuntil the civil war.  Then one day a boatload of northern soldierslanded on the island and took possession.  None of the men of the familywere at home.  It chanced, however, that a young Confederate officer wason leave of absence visiting the girl to whom he was engaged.  When thenortherners surrounded the house, she hid him in one of the secretpassages.  The story goes that she was insulted by one of the enemy anddrowned herself in the blue lagoon.  The young officer, waiting herreturn and not knowing how to escape, starved to death."Gill shivered."Good gracious, what a tale on a night like this!  No matter howbeautiful a place is, nor how shut off from the world, it seems neverable to escape sorrow."Allan Drain looked more closely at his companion, whose expression wasscarcely discernible in the flickering lights made by the Chineselanterns, swinging like censers between the trees that led to the bluelagoon. The winter before she would not have been capable of a speechlike this!"I am sorry, perhaps I should not have told you so unhappy a story.  Ishould have remembered that you have been ill and in trouble.  I havenot had an opportunity before to express my sympathy.  I have beenthrough such a lot of bad health myself, at least I appreciate what _it_means.""You are all right now, or a great deal stronger?  Certainly you lookso.  You are kind to be so good to me.  I was so stupid and disagreeablewhen you were ill and lonely during the winter in the Adirondacks. Iseem to be one of the persons who has to learn through experience.Until recently I have always been so well and I am afraid spoiled.  Ihope I shall never be so impossible again.  Tell me do you feel moreinterested in your medical studies, or is writing still your oneambition?""I am ashamed to say that it is, ashamed because I seem to have solittle talent to justify all the time and thought I give to it, when Ishould be hard at work trying to learn my profession.  I often fear I amone of the people who shall fall between the two, a failure in both.  Idid not intend to be so dismal, but I have had a pretty severedisappointment of late.""I am sorry, would you rather tell me of it, or not?"By this time they had reached the edge of the lagoon and stood lookingdown at the water, so deep a blue it was nearly black under the nightsky with the stars reflected in its surface.There were few waves and only a light breeze; a small row-boat tied to astake lapped gently to and fro."Would you like to go for a row?  I am not a skillful oarsman, but I canmanage. We need not be out long."Gill hesitated."I would like it very much, but we must be sure to return before thedance is over. I won’t be able to help with the rowing, I have neverattempted it in my life.  You know I am an inland person and never havespent any time near the sea until now.  I never saw the ocean until wecrossed to France."With the boat untied, Allan helped his companion in and Gill sat downfacing him.Neither of them spoke until they were a few yards from the shore andmoving toward the opening into the bay."Yes, I would like to tell you of my disappointment.  I have not wishedto speak of it to any one else, why you will understand when I explainthe circumstances."Last winter in New York Mrs. Graham suggested that, when I came to makeher a visit in the spring at the ’House by the Blue Lagoon’, I mightbring with me the manuscript of the play, which I have been at work uponfor a year and that she would persuade Mrs. Burton to allow me to readit to her.  Of course with this possibility I have worked doubly harduntil there have been moments, not many I confess, when my play has notseemed altogether bad.  I have had Mrs. Burton in mind as I wrote; Icould not help this, she is the only great actress I have ever knownpersonally and in some ways the greatest I have ever seen act.  I don’tbelieve I have been mad enough to dream that she would like my play wellenough to appear in it, but I hoped that she might say a few words ofencouragement, perhaps give me a letter of introduction to a manager whowould read my play if she made the request.""Well, what has happened?" Gill demanded, leaning forward with her lipsslightly parted, her eyes large and interested fixed upon hercompanion’s face."Only that Mrs. Burton declines to be annoyed.  Mrs. Graham did notoffer exactly this explanation, but what she said amounted to the samething.  Please don’t think I am blaming Mrs. Burton, I understand herposition.  She sent word to me that she was very tired after a winter ofhard work and that for the present wished to forget the stagealtogether.  She begged me to appreciate that she was not a producer ofplays and that her opinion of what I have written would be of smallvalue.  In case she did not like my work she might disappoint me, when amanager might be delighted with what I have accomplished.""Yes, that is true," Gill returned, "so why feel especiallydisappointed?  I am sure Mrs. Burton will give you a letter to amanager, even if she prefers not to read your play."With the peculiar despondency which is an attribute of the artistictemperament, Allan Drain shook his head."No, if Mrs. Burton is not interested, I do not care to interest any oneelse.  With every line I have written I have thought and dreamed of heras my heroine.  I don’t want any one else to play it, at least this isthe way I feel at present."In several moments Gill did not speak, while Allan Drain pulled hard athis oars, wishing to conquer his discouragement through strenuousphysical exercise.He was surprised when his boat so soon shot out of the lagoon into thebroader waters of the bay.  The waves were not high and he rowed quietlyand steadfastly, keeping close, as he believed to the shores of thesmall island.Still Gill dreamed on, feeling wonderfully peaceful and happier than inmany months. She never had forgiven herself for her carelessness inthrowing the manuscript of Allan Drain’s verses into the fire in theirwinter cabin at Half Moon Lake.  Now it was a consolation to discoverthat Allan Drain really had forgiven her; there was no pretence in hiswords and friendliness to-night. If only she had possessed sufficientinfluence with their Camp Fire guardian to persuade her to do what he sogreatly wished!  After all it was not so tremendous a favor, in Gill’sestimation.  However, if Mrs. Burton had refused the request made by herhostess and most dearly loved friend, no one else would avail."I am so sorry, I do wish I could be of service," Gill murmured,speaking as much to herself as to her companion.  "Don’t you thinkperhaps we had better start home? I don’t wish to, I did not realizethat I was so tired watching the dancing and being in the midst of somany people until you brought me out into this beauty and quiet.""Yes, well I’ll go on only a few moments longer and then turn around.Once we are inside the lagoon we can reach our landing in a quarter ofan hour."When he spoke Allan was not aware that the wind was growing stronger andthat the tide was turning and running out toward the sea.  Neither didhe realize the length of time he and Gill had been on the water, nor thedistance they had gone, so swiftly and smoothly his oars worked, as thebeat moved in unison with the tide.Ten minutes after their brief conversation, in attempting to swingaround, Allan discovered that he had a task ahead of him. To hissurprise and consternation he also found that already he was fatigued.He had been out on the water only once since his arrival at the islandand then in company with David Hale who was an excellent oarsman.  Ithad not occurred to him that as he had rowed only two or three times inseveral years he was not in training.Fortunately his companion was not aware of his difficulty and wasremaining blessedly silent, so that he could give his entire attentionto his rowing.Allan strained and pulled, realizing that the wind was blowing him outof his course.A half hour he kept on without faltering, always with the intention ofreaching the shores of the island and skirting it until he coulddiscover the lagoon.  And always his companion continued silent.When he had time to think, Allan concluded that she had fallen asleepand was grateful.If he could not get in to shore he was managing not be driven far out ofthe course.At midnight the small steamboat would call at the island to take theguests back to the mainland, who were not to spend the night, and withluck he might be able to signal them."Don’t you think you had better rest for a few moments, Mr. Drain?"  Aquiet voice suggested.  "Please don’t be worried, I am not uneasy.  Atthe worst, if we cannot reach the lagoon and no boat comes to ourrescue, we shall only drift about until the tide turns.  When daylightarrives we shall have no difficulty.  I hate your wearing yourself outand wish I could help."Gill laughed, a more courageous, gayer laugh than he had heard from hersince their earlier acquaintance."Why, you did not think I was asleep? I am not so stupid as all that! Idid not wish to trouble you by talking."Compelled to follow Gill’s advice, resting his oars, Allan allowed theirboat to move with the tide.  Another half hour went by; at length bothof them appreciated that it must be well past midnight and there waslittle chance of rescue by their friends.  The small steamboat crosseddirectly from the island to the mainland and made no circuit of the bay.Without comment Allan picked up his oars again."I think I can manage to reach the island, even if we do not discoverthe lagoon before dawn.  I have walked around the island several timesand there are a number of places where one can land.  We will be morecomfortable than in this cramped little boat and warmer.  Besides we arein some danger with the waves growing higher and stronger and the nightdarker.  I am not going to attempt to disguise the fact from you, youare as courageous as I am, in truth you are more courageous as Iremember you.  If you wish to have the score settled with me in regardto the accidental burning of my manuscript, I have accomplished it witha vengeance to-night by bringing you out on the water and getting youinto this difficulty.  I only hope you may not be ill again as a resultof my stupidity.  But I must not talk, I have no breath to spare.  Oncewe are safe and ashore I’ll offer my apology.""Don’t worry about me.  If it were not that the others may be troubled,and I trust Mrs. Graham and Mrs. Burton went to their rooms beforeanyone missed us, and if you were not wearing yourself out, do you knowI could enjoy this experience. I am not in the slightest degreefrightened, I suppose I am a kind of an adventurer."A quarter of an hour after, Allan and Gill beheld a darker line of landand rowing closer their boat grounded in the sand amid shallow water."I’ll carry you ashore, it will be simpler than trying to get in by anyother method. Then I’ll wade out and drag the boat after us.""I can wade, please don’t, I am far too heavy," Gill protested,remembering the character of illness from which Allan Drain had sufferedat the time of their first meeting.As he lifted her from her place and her arms closed about his throat,there was no sign of weakness in her companion.Five minutes later she was seated on the dry sand, able to see the tallfigure struggling in the darkness and drawing the heavy boat ashore."You should have allowed me to help, it was not fair," Gill arguedalmost angrily, as, panting for breath, he dropped down at her side withthe boat only a few feet away.                             *CHAPTER XII*                            *THE CAMP FIRE*"No, I don’t need your coat.  With the heat from the fire the whitescarf is sufficiently warm.  I am grateful to you for making me bring italong. I don’t think we had best sit still at present. You are sooverheated, it will be wiser to cool off slowly.  Do you mind my takingyour arm?  I am blind in the dark, blinder than most persons, andalthough this coast is chiefly sand there are a few rocks in unexpectedplaces."  The girl extended her hand.With a groan at Gill’s words, Allan Drain half arose to a sittingposture."Don’t be so sensible; I realize that it would be more intelligent totramp about until we get rid of the stiffness from our cramped positionin the boat and until I feel less like a wet blanket, yet the desire ofmy heart at present is to stretch out here by the fire and not to stirsave to put on fresh firewood.""Poor woodsman, how long would our few sticks last?" Gill remonstrated."Be a man; if you won’t come with me I shall have to go stumbling alongin the dark, picking up more driftwood until we have a supply that willlast all night.  After a time we shall probably be too sleepy to exertourselves.  It is rather fun, isn’t it, playing Robinson Crusoe and hisman Friday, when we cannot be more than a few miles from the house andthe lagoon? At dawn we can reach home in an hour or so, but to gotramping about the island in the dark with no idea of the directionstrikes me as the height of absurdity.  I am sorry you do not likesensible persons, because I do try to be sensible on occasions.  Isuppose it is too much to expect of a poet. Come with me, please?""Did you suppose I would allow you to wander off alone, even if I ampoet, or struggle to be one?" Allan Drain demanded, feeling Gill’sslender fingers close firmly on his arm.  "Do you know it never occurredto me that you and I would be friends, but after to-night I shall insistupon it, whether you like me or not.  Don’t dare say that I do not likesensible persons, I never liked anything better than the calm fashion inwhich you accept our dilemma, treating it as if it were rather a joke,than a disaster. Do you mind if I mention that you have not oncesuggested that there might be any gossip, or even discussion of the factthat you and I are forced to spend the night, in this--in this--well, inthis informal fashion."Gill laughed and stumbled a little, her companion promptly assistingher."Of course I have thought of it, but it makes no difference.  This is nospecial virtue on my part; as soon as we are able to explain, none ofthe house party will consider the subject again.  Yet I believe I amcapable of going ahead in this world and doing what I think right, evenif people should talk.  Perhaps I am mistaken, one really never knowsabout oneself.  Isn’t that a log I fell over a moment ago?  If you takeone end and I the other it will burn a long time.  Then in case any onecomes to look for us they can discover us by the sign of the redflower.""Red flower?  What are you talking about?" Allan Drain said irritably,feeling uninterested in further physical exertion, now that he hadlanded Gill safely on the island and had only to wait a few hours beforethey could row or walk home."Wait until I can tell you," Gill answered.A few moments after, when they had carefully laid the old log, cast upon the island after voyaging upon what unknown waters, on the camp fireand stood watching the flames leap up into the night, blue, rose andgold, Gill added:"Did you not know that in the old days our forefathers called flame, the’Red Flower’?  If by any chance the tribal fire died out they wentforth, sometimes to war, to steal the ’Red Flower’ from the enemy."Allan Drain remained silent.Glancing at him and seeing his face lit by the glow, Gill was startledby his expression."You can’t guess what you have just done for me?  Oh, it may not seem ofimportance to you, and yet I can scarcely explain how much it means tome.  For months and months I have been trying to find a title for my newplay and now you have given me the perfect title: ’The Red Flower’. It’sa wonder!  The theme of my play is the flame of life that burns for goodor ill in each one of us, and burns with greater beauty and purity in myheroine than in any one else."Forgive me, to think of my daring to talk of my play and myself (for attimes they seem the same thing) with you here in the cold and dark,waiting for morning! Shall we continue to walk, or will you rest for alittle, while I explore.  It is possible I may find a more comfortableplace than this for you."Gill sat down, resting her chin in her hand and gazing into the fire.She could hear the waves lapping against the shore of the little islandand behind her the wind rustling in the trees.After to-night, surely she and Allan Drain must be good friends as hehad stated.  In any case her former prejudice against him was vanishing.If he were willing to believe that this night’s experience canceled theinjury she had done him, the price was not severe.Gill looked up at the stars; it must now be between two and threeo’clock in the morning.  She only could hope that her Camp Fireguardian, her hostess and friends were not seriously troubled.  Thisthought alone made her unhappy, although she was beginning to feel wearyand lonely now that Allan Drain had disappeared, if only for a fewmoments."Miss Gilchrist, Gill," she heard him calling, using her diminutive namein his excitement for the first time in their acquaintance.  "I havediscovered a tiny house an eighth of a mile back from the shore, afisherman’s cottage I think it must be.  I have noticed one or two ofthese huts when I have tramped over the island. It isn’t clean and it ispretty dark, but it is under shelter and if you will go in and rest I’llkeep guard outside until daylight."Gill shook her head."Leave our fire and the stars and the outdoors?  Thank you, no.  We willsit here together and you won’t mind if I doze now and then.  See here,Mr. Drain, Allan Drain, when we met in the Adirondacks you did not likeme because you thought I was like a boy.  I know it is unattractive, butto-night suppose you try to think of me as a boy, as if we were twocomrades who had met with an unexpected adventure, for which one was nomore to blame than the other, and that we were both determined to makethe best of it."If you don’t mind sitting closer I’ll lean against your shoulder a fewmoments.  If I am a nuisance don’t hesitate to say so."In ten minutes Allan Drain discovered that his companion was asleep,this time in reality.Her red-brown hair having tumbled partly down--Gill had unloosened it,so that it hung crisp and straight to her shoulders--her pallor seemedstrangely to have departed with the night’s adventure, or else her skinwas warmed by the heat from the fire; her lips, irregular in shape, wereslightly parted.An interesting face, Allan Drain concluded, if not a beautiful one, anda nature, generous and faulty, which so far was not fully awakened.Doubtless she would fight valiantly for a friend, but might prove aformidable enemy.Gill stirred, and without being aware of the fact her companion smiled.After the night’s experience would they be enemies or friends?  He hopedand intended they should be friends, as he had announced earlier in theevening.Few girls, in his estimation, possessed the gift for friendship.  Andpersonally there was no possibility of a relation deeper than friendshipin his own life for many years; whether as a physician or a writer, hehad a long and difficult road to travel before he could expect even afair amount of wealth.Now and then during the next few hours Allan dozed.  Occasionally hewould have to awaken Gill by rising and going forth in search of freshfirewood.At dawn they both opened their eyes at the same moment.A mist was rising from the sea, curling heavenward and scattered bylight winds.In the sky there was an indefinite, faint glow.Later the clouds parted and Allan recalled his reading of the Iliad andHomer’s description of Apollo and his immortal horses and chariot.Almost one could see them move across the sky trailing clouds of glory.Then the colors blended and day arrived.In the interval neither Allan nor Gill spoke after their first goodmorning.Finally Gill stood up, stretching out her arms, her face radiant."Never shall I forget the beauty of this dawn, never as long as I live.I had not thought to see the morning come up out of the ocean.  I begyour pardon if I seem too enthusiastic; please remember that I was bornand brought up in Kansas and an island in the midst of the sea is almostas thrilling an experience as the sight of a new planet. Now I’lldescend to realities and go and wash my face in the salt water.  Shallwe walk or row back home?  I’m starving, aren’t you?""Then what do you say to remaining an hour longer and catching fish andfrying them for breakfast?  Perhaps I can find fishing tackle in the hutI stumbled into last night."On the way to the water Gill called back over her shoulder."Don’t tempt me, we must return as soon as possible.""Then we will row home; it will be quicker and save the trouble ofbringing the boat in later.  Besides, how much more dignified to rowcalmly up the blue lagoon than to tramp across the island!"Gill rejoined him and was attempting to fix her hair."Sorry to disappoint you, but there is nothing to suggest dignity ineither one of us at present.  I am judging by your appearance andguessing at my own.""Sure you feel none the worse for the night outdoors?"Then as she shook her head, Allan made no further comment, althoughconscious of the fact that few persons would have passed through thediscomforts of such a night and on awaking make no reference to anythingsave the beauty of the morning.There were a number of other circumstances Allan felt he would like tomention--the soreness of his arms and back, the stiffness of his legs, ageneral shiveriness and a sensation of not having been to sleep in ages.Yet in the face of Gill’s better sporting instinct he declined tocomplain.  The freshness and splendor of the dawn had brought a physicalas well as spiritual exaltation.Landing at the accustomed place in less than an hour, as they approachedthe old house no one appeared to be stirring except the birds in theeaves."Do you suppose by some good fortune no one has missed us?  One scarcelyknows whether to be pleased or chagrined.  At least I shall awakenBettina and recount our adventure.  Good-by, I shall try to sleep mostof the day and see you to-night I hope."As Gill nodded her farewell, Allan left her at the door of the big houseand went on to one of the cabins nearby, which was at present occupiedby the half dozen masculine guests.By this time it was approaching six o’clock and Gill discovered that oneof the maids had unlocked the front door.  Going in, she went directlyto Bettina’s room. When there was no immediate answer to her knock shewalked quietly in.Bettina sat up in bed, looking like a princess in a fairy tale with hertwo long braids of light hair falling over her shoulders and hernightdress of silk and lace. Notwithstanding Bettina’s ideas of serviceand devotion to the less fortunate, her mother insisted, and Bettina wasnot unwilling, that she wear beautiful clothes.  As her mother boughtthe clothes and gave them to her, Bettina had no alternative."Gill, what _is_ the matter?  Are you ill, do you need anything?  Whyyou are dressed in the same frock that you wore last night at thedance."Bettina rubbed her eyes, becoming more aware of her surroundings, asGill stood laughing and gazing down upon her."So this is what it means to be shipwrecked and spend the night on anisland in the society of a poet?  One returns to find one never has beenmissed.""Sit down, Gill, and talk sensibly. Shipwrecked?  Island?  Are you stilldreaming? Did you not go up to your room last night before the dance wasover and retire before the rest of us?  When I found you had vanished,Sally told me that you had said you were tired and that no one was topay any attention to you if you disappeared.""Yes, I did tell Sally that and was about to depart when Allan Drainasked me to go for a walk with him.  Afterwards we went to row for ahalf hour on the lagoon, managed to slip into the bay and, when the tideturned, were carried farther out.  We discovered the island, but not theblue lagoon and were forced to wait until daylight.  I am sorry, Irealized when it was too late that I should not have gone, but tried tomake the best of it and to accept the situation in a matter-of-factfashion.  I am going to bed now.  Will you explain to your mother andMrs. Burton that I’ll go into the details of our adventure when I am notso tired.  At least the thing I feared did not occur, you were notfrightened and did not believe the water had swallowed us up."                             *CHAPTER XIII*                          *THE FOLLOWING DAY*Not in several years could Sally Ashton recall so trying a day as thepresent one, not since those fateful days in France when she had nursedan unknown soldier in a ruined château.In the first place, she was worried about Gill.  Characteristic of Gillto insist that the night outdoors in the fog and cold probably had beengood for her; Sally was not under a similar impression.  Devotedly andfaithfully she had nursed and watched the other girl during the pastwinter, to discover that Gill possessed a boyish carelessness and lackof judgment concerning her own health.So in and out of Gill’s room, Sally spent a portion of her morning,carrying in the breakfast tray, insisting that Gill, in spite of herprotests, use a hot water bag prevent her taking cold.At eleven o’clock again she tiptoed softly back, and finding Gill awakedeparted to bring a glass of milk, in case she should prefer to sleep onthrough luncheon."I may not be able to come in to see you during the afternoon, Gill;Bettina suggests that, as she is your hostess, I might permit her tohave a little of the care of you, so I agreed.  There is something elseI may have to attend to and you seem all right."With a harrassed, even troubled air, unlike her usual serenity, Sallystood frowning, looking not at Gill, but out the open window.Gill stretched forth her hand."Sally, dear, what is the matter?  You are not worrying about me, thatis too absurd!  You are a perfect dear and I am everlastingly grateful,but I have not even taken cold.  There is something else on your mind.If you don’t wish to confide in me, why not tell some one, Mrs. Grahamor Mrs. Burton."Sally failed to lift her eyes."No, not at present.  I had thought of speaking to Aunt Betty and thendecided I had best wait.  Tante is absolutely out of the question.  Bythe way, she was much upset when she heard what had happened to you andAllan Drain, but after a talk with Allan is in a happier frame of mind.I was to tell you that she would see you when you were more rested."Sally waited, as if trying to reach a decision before stirring from herpresent position."Gill, if there was something you believe you ought to do, would you goahead, even if it made some one you cared for angry?" she unexpectedlydemanded.Gill studied her closely."I don’t know what to answer, as would depend partly upon circumstancesBut, Sally, dear, please don’t get yourself into any difficulty.  Youhave been through a trying winter with me and are here by the bluelagoon for a holiday."Sally shook her head."I’ll do my best to avoid it."A few moments before lunch Sally discovered Dan Webster alone on thefront porch and went toward him in her sweetest and most friendlyfashion."It is nice to find you by yourself, Dan. You said last night that I hadbeen avoiding you, which was not exactly true.  I have had something onmy mind and it is hard, as you know, at a house party, to slip away fromthe others."Dan laughed."Yes, Sally, but it is the very fact of your slipping away from theothers that I did object to.  Had you gone with me I might have feltdifferently."Sally put out her hand, catching at her companion’s coat sleeve."Promise me, Dan, that if I do something you don’t like, you won’t beangry? You might have a little faith in me!"Dan shook his head."Faith or no faith, Sally, I won’t have you trudging over this islandalone on any kind of fool’s errand.  If you do what I asked you not, Ishall find it hard to forgive you.  Let’s not talk of this; why not comefor a walk with me this afternoon?  We have not had a walk in ages!""No, Dan, I can’t, I am sorry, but I am tired from waiting on Gill allmorning and from the dance last night and mean to have a nap."Then to Sally’s relief, Mrs. Graham appeared on the veranda and luncheonwas announced.In the afternoon from her bedroom window Sally saw most of the houseparty disappear.  They were crossing over to the mainland to watch adrill at the fort.  She had declined to go, but was happy to observethat Dan was with them and walking with Vera Lagerloff, whom he hadknown since they were children.A short time after, making a pretence of keeping her word, Sally laydown on her bed for five minutes.  Then she arose, put on a sweater anda small, close-fitting hat and unobserved went downstairs.  Instead ofgoing out at once, however, she slipped into the drawing-room and satdown by a window where she was almost completely concealed by thecurtain.She sat there about a half hour.  At the end of that time another memberof the house-party appeared from a side door, glanced about her, as ifwondering whether she was observed, and then started alone, presumablyfor a walk.Not at once, but within two or three moments, Sally arose and followedher.  By walking rapidly she might be able to join her; by loitering shemight keep her in view.As the girl walked quickly and as Sally was not fond of strenuousexercise, she was forced to hurry in order not to lose sight of her.After an hour and a quarter of fast walking the girl in advance reachedthe small fisherman’s hut which Allan Drain had discovered the nightbefore.She remained waiting in the open doorway until a small boat landed onthe beach and a young man jumped out.  Then she ran forward to meet him.From her place of concealment behind a clump of trees Sally was neithersurprised nor shocked.  There was no question with regard to thelikeness between Juliet Temple and her companion, plainly they weresister and brother.  Then why did Juliet Temple not bring her brother tothe "House by the Blue Lagoon"?  The question puzzled and troubledSally.After all, she was making a mistake.  If another girl chose to havesecret meetings with her own brother, it was not her affair.Had she not always distrusted Juliet Temple and believed she intendedsome wrong purpose, never would she have pursued her present course.Dan must never learn what she had been doing, or he might be not onlyangry but disdainful.Sally turned and started home, sitting down now and then to rest.Having finally made up her mind to cease playing detective, she was in amore comfortable frame of mind.Should Juliet Temple by any chance overtake her, Sally determined toconfess.                             *CHAPTER XIV*                             *AN INTERVIEW*Seated on a log and looking out toward the water, hearing some onecoming up behind her, not anxious to begin an interview which might leadto uncomfortable explanations, Sally did not turn her head.When some one called her name, she jumped quickly to her feet andswinging around, faced Dan Webster.Instantly her face grew scarlet."You have followed me, Dan.  I shall never forgive you.  Deliberatelyyou made a pretence of going away with the others for the afternoon inorder that I might be deceived."Sally’s words were harsher than her manner, for even as she spoke sheput her hands to her hot cheeks and her voice trembled.Dan was looking at her as she never had seen him.  His usually ruddy,freshly colored skin had lost nearly every vestige of color, his lipswere set and hard and his blue eyes at once stern and unhappy."Certainly I followed you, Sally, I told you that was my intention, andyou are perfectly right in your supposition that I tricked you byappearing to leave the island. I did this not because I really believedyou would continue your secret meetings, but because I wanted to beconvinced.""Secret meetings!" Sally exclaimed, moving backwards a step or two anddropping her hands at her sides.  "I think it is my right, Dan, to askwhat you mean.""Why, I mean what I said.  How could I mean anything else?  Please don’tmake things worse by failing to tell the truth, particularly now when itis too late to do anything else.  I have been tramping about for thepast half hour trying to decide what was best.  I am going directly toTante, and I wish you would come with me, and tell her that you have hadhalf a dozen secret meetings with a young fellow who lands on the islandin an out-of-the-way spot, instead of using the lagoon where he could beseen from the house.  Doubtless you will explain your reason."Sally was silent, her face now paler than her companion’s."Of course I know, Sally, there is no harm in what you have been doing,but you yourself will confess that it does not look well and that anyonewho cares for you has a right to try to protect you from your ownindiscretion.  Who is this fellow?  Is he some friend whom you don’tthink the rest of us would care to know?  And for what reason?  I sawyou stop behind a clump of trees and a few moments later his boat landedand I walked away.  I did mot wish actually to spy upon you.  You mustonly have spoken to him, as it was a brief time ago.  Perhaps you arebefriending this fellow in some way; if you are, why not let me help?""I am befriending no one," Sally returned."Then come with me to Tante.  Perhaps you will confide in your Camp Fireguardian. I was never so disappointed in any human being in my life,Sally, as I am in you.  I feel as if I were in a nightmare from which Imust wake up."[Illustration: "I Was Never So Disappointed in Any Human Being in MyLife, Sally, As I Am in You."]Almost roughly Dan took Sally by the arm.The next instant she had broken away and a second time seated herself onthe log."Go and tell whom you like, Dan Webster, and whatever you like, and notonly Tante, but Aunt Betty and the entire group of Camp Fire girls.  Besure to miss no one.  Afterwards don’t speak to me again."Hesitating, his sternness slightly relaxed, as whose would not have beenby the sight of Sally, Dan took one step in her direction and thenpaused.  Unexpectedly her head went down, the golden brown eyes that hadbeen so full of defiance the moment before, filled and brimmed over, asshe buried her head in her hands.He was under the impression that he had been sufficiently unhappy uponmaking the discovery that she was keeping a secret from her friends, buthis past unhappiness was as nothing to this."Sally, dear, I am afraid I spoke rudely to you.  You know I wasconcerned for your sake.  Of course I am not going to speak of thematter to Tante, as you’ll tell her yourself at once.""I shall do no such thing, Dan," Sally answered in a muffled tone.Dan appeared and felt defeated.Slowly he began walking up and down a few feet away, his head bowed, anexpression of anxiety and depression on his handsome, boyish face.Finally he came and stood in front of the girl."Sally, I want to apologize to you, you must do what you think best.You asked me to have faith in you and I have not had. Good-by.  I won’task you to walk home with me, but come soon, dear, you are tired andupset and ought to rest before dinner."Dan was moving away when Sally caught up with him."Dan, please listen.  I want to tell you what actually has happened, Inever wanted to tell anyone anything so much in my whole existence.  Iam afraid you will think I have not behaved very well, but you may scoldas much as you like because I agree with you."Of course I have not been meeting any strange youth for any purposewhatsoever. What I have been doing is following Juliet Temple and I havelittle excuse to offer."Soon after her arrival I noticed that she slipped off several timesalone and one day I followed her, partly from curiosity and the olddistrust I always have felt for her.  It is a curious thing, Dan.  Ibelieve Juliet is honestly fond of Tante, but I think in the end shewill use her for her own purpose."Well, Juliet went farther than I expected and I saw her meet some onewhom I feel sure is her brother, as they look so exactly alike.Besides, I heard that he was a soldier and most of the time he is inuniform.  It is Juliet’s affair of course and she probably has somelegitimate excuse for not wishing us to know him, but I confess ittroubles me."In a way I feel I owe an apology to Juliet, but it might be morecomfortable for us both not to speak of it.  I was just reaching adecision to forget the whole matter when you interrupted and frightenedme.  If you doubt what I have told you, Dan, you can wait until Julietreturns and tell her what I have told you.  I would prefer she and Tanteshould both know than that you should doubt me.""But I don’t doubt your word, Sally; nothing would ever induce me todoubt you now or in the future," Dan returned with more earnestness thanhis previous point of view gave him the excuse for possessing. "Besides,now I recall that twice I have seen Juliet Temple not far away, soonafter observing you.  I am a dunce and a blockhead and your devotedfriend, Sally."Why in the world do you feel this distrust of Juliet Temple?  No wonderTante thinks she has a hard time among you girls and appeals to me to bekind to her.  She seems to me a tiresome kind of girl, who isn’t capableof anything out of the ordinary. She is clever enough to be a goodsecretary, or companion, or whatever she is to Tante, and that is theend of it.""Think so, Dan?  Well, perhaps you are right," Sally replied.  "Supposewe hurry home.  I don’t wish to appear as if you had made me cry,although it is perfectly true that you have.""Never as long as we live shall I trouble you again."Wise in things feminine, Sally shook her head and smiled.                              *CHAPTER XV*                            *TWISTED COILS*"If you can finish, Juliet, without further assistance from me, Ibelieve I will go and look for the Camp Fire girls.  They have been sobusy with their own affairs of late, I feel slightly neglected. Then dotake a walk, or lie down, whichever you prefer.  You have been looking alittle nervous and pale of late.  I would understand if you had beenworking hard, but we both have been having a holiday."Mrs. Burton stood before her mirror making soft little pats at her hair,characteristic of all girls and women.She had on a house dress of crepe de chine in a curious shade of oldgold with a girdle of brown velvet."I can’t become accustomed to my appearance in this dress, Juliet.  Itseems to me I look rather worse than usual.  I wish it were becoming toyou so I might present it to you, but I am afraid the color is wrong."Juliet Temple made no reply and seemed scarcely to have heard what hadbeen said to her.  She was seated at a desk with several bills and acheck book before her.As Mrs. Burton, preparing to leave the room, opened the door, she saidin a low tone:"Would you mind signing these checks before you go?  One is for the rentof the apartment.""Tante, won’t you come for a ride with us around the island?  We won’tbe long!" Bettina Graham called at the same instant from outside in thehall."Wait a moment, dear, and I’ll join you. Give me the checks, Juliet,please.  What an abominable pen!  Are the three all you wish me tosign?""Yes, all for the present," Juliet answered, gathering them hastilytogether and placing one over the other.At the same time Mrs. Burton went out of the room."I don’t feel like driving, Bettina.  I was intending to see what yougirls were doing and perhaps have an impromptu Camp Fire meeting.  Wehave been neglecting our Council meetings of late and it is not a goodplan, yet I know it is difficult with so many masculine guests to beentertained. Who is going for the drive?""Oh, no one except my shadows, as you call my two small girls, and DavidHale and Marguerite Arnot.  Marguerite has been so busy helping motherlook after the house she and David have scarcely been able to exchange aword, and you know I always have wished them to be friends. Mother saidshe would go if you liked, but not otherwise.""Are the other girls here?  I’ll find mother when she has rested, I knowthis is the hour she lies down.""Yes, I think they are in the house somewhere.  I am not sure aboutSally.  I heard Dan ask her to go for a row and heard Sally decline, butshe may have changed her mind, even Sally sometimes does change hermind--for Dan."I must hurry, but if you pass my room, dear, will you look at the oldEnglish prints that father found and presented me for my sitting-room.They are so lovely I feel mother should have them, but she insists not."Bettina ran off down the stairs and Mrs. Burton moved toward the frontof the old house, where Bettina’s apartment of bedroom and sitting-roomwas located.Coming toward her through the hall with a book under his arm was AllanDrain."I beg your pardon, Mrs. Burton, if I am intruding by being up here,when I know this second floor is the feminine part of the house, butMiss Bettina told me I could get this book from her bookcase.  I wastrying to escape without being discovered."The Camp Fire guardian laughed."Oh, the situation is not so serious as that.  You need not run away.Stop a moment, won’t you?  I want to speak to you.  I have beenintending to for the past ten days.  I am afraid you think I am unkindand selfish not to allow you to read your new play to me.  I know Mrs.Graham tried to explain as pleasantly as possible, but the fact remainsthat I did refuse, even when she asked me and I don’t like to refuse hermany things.  I was tired; you see I have not acted for a number ofyears and the past winter was a good deal of a strain. Besides, I am thepoorest kind of a critic! I want you to know that I trust your play willbe a great success, and if not this, then the next one.  It is a longand oftentimes difficult road you have started to travel, yet I presumeit is like acting, if the thing is in your blood, you must keep at itthrough good and ill.  Forgive me and understand my attitude.  I amafraid I am growing more selfish as I grow older, but I don’t wish youto feel this all unkindness, I might have to say something discouragingand I might be wrong and then I should have hurt you for nothing."Polly Burton held out her hand in the simple, friendly fashioncharacteristic of her.  As the young fellow took it and held it for aninstant she saw in his face the beauty and honor of a sincere and ardentadmiration, not for her as a woman, but as an artist."Thank you," he returned, "I do understand and I have not the leastright to trouble you.  You have been too kind in the past.  The road ishard because I have my living to make and cannot afford to work and waitas one should.  I only trust I have the courage to hold out."Waiting for Mrs. Burton to move away, his eyes never left her,consciously studying the slender, graceful figure, the small head withits mass of dark hair and the brilliant blue eyes, the mark of her Irishinheritance, yet of less interest than the long, too thin face, with thepointed chin and the irregular, deeply colored lips."Have you a name for your play? The title is so important.  I hated thetitle of mine last winter, in spite of its Shakespearean significance itwas too difficult to say, ’A Tide in the Affairs’.""Yes, I think I have.  Only the other night Miss Gilchrist, Gill, gaveit to me by accident while we waited for the coming of morning by ourCamp Fire.  She spoke of flame as ’The Red Flower’.  Do you like it,’The Red Flower’, as a title?"Mrs. Burton uttered a little exclamation."Yes, I do, immensely.  See here, Allan, would you like to compromisewith me and allow me to read your play to myself.  If I like it I shalltell you so; if I don’t I shall say nothing, so as not to influence you.In any case I should prefer not having you read it aloud.  Most personsread so poorly and if they don’t, it is more confusing.  I can get myown impression much better if I am alone and it is under my own eyes."Allan gripped the mahogany post of the balustrade until the veins stoodup on his hands."You mean you really will read it?  Of course I should rather you wouldread it to yourself.  I should be sure to make a wreck of it.  Yet Iought not to be such a nuisance, and please don’t think I expect you tosay anything good of it."Again Mrs. Burton laughed."Look here, Allan, I know the artistic temperament too well to bedeceived by you.  You don’t mind being a nuisance one bit if you canhave your own way, no one of us artists minds.  And, my dear boy, ofcourse you expect me to say your play is good; if you did not, you wouldnever allow me to look at it.  You expect this one moment and the nextyou are in utter despair because you are convinced it is the poorestplay ever written or conceived."I’ll do my best for you, only you must not worry if I am rather a timegetting at it.  I must rest and forget the theater for a little longer.""I shall wait forever, if you desire and be everlastingly gratefulalways," Allan said so fervently that Polly Burton, recalling her ownyouth had an emotion of sympathy and determined not to keep him waitingfor her judgment for any great length of time.Bettina’s sitting-room door was open and the moment after she went inand stood looking about the room.Youth was always hard to understand, even if it understood itself, whichit never does.Here was Bettina’s little apartment as exquisite as any girl could dreamof, or desire.  The rugs were of a wonderful blue, the color she lovedbest, the walls more lightly colored, the furniture not the massivemahogany of most old southern houses, but of an English design, thefamous Chippendale.  Outside her windows Bettina had a view of the bluelagoon and the wider bay beyond.  Yet she preferred to leave all thisbeauty and luxury and spend her life in the slums."Well, life is only an expression of human personality, and if Bettinais in earnest, she has the right to do what she wishes," Mrs. Burtonthought, as she picked up one of the prints Bettina had asked her toexamine.As she stood holding it in her hand she heard Alice Ashton and VeraLagerloff talking together in the adjoining room with the door betweenpartly open."Don’t you think, Vera, that one or the other of us should go at once toAunt Patricia?  I know she said neither of us was to come, but that doesnot alter our responsibility.  She must need some one."Mrs. Burton put down the picture she scarcely had seen and took a stepforward, then paused."It is so impossible to think of Aunt Patricia as poor, isn’t it? Eversince we have known her she has been lavishing her wealth in everydirection, upon every one except herself.  It is like her now to declarethat she has paid the rent of our little New York apartment for a yearand that we are not to think of making any changes before then.  Don’tyou suppose we can persuade her to come and live with us for the presentat least until she decides what she wishes to do permanently?" Verasuggested."Yes, but Aunt Patricia insists she is going to find work, that at lastshe is glad she never has had a gray hair.  She seems really not to beso unhappy over the situation as we are for her.  Her only fearapparently is that we shall take Tante into our confidence concerningher.  And frankly this makes me uncomfortable!  I think Tante should betold.  But I shall leave you to talk the matter over with Aunt Betty.  Iam going to Boston in the morning.  I shall see father and mother andask them to go with me to Aunt Patricia’s house, it is just outside oftown.  Then we can face the situation together.""An excellent idea, Alice, but I shall go in your place.  I have justoverheard what you and Vera were saying.  As you were speaking of AuntPatricia and I think it my right to know of her, notwithstanding herattitude toward me, I made no effort not to hear."Now, please tell me in detail so far as you know what has occurred."An instant Alice Ashton hesitated, but there was something in her CampFire guardian’s manner and expression that commanded obedience.  Veryseldom in her life had she assumed this attitude, when she did, no onedreamed of opposing her."Why, yes, Tante, I’ll tell you and am very glad to be relieved of theresponsibility. This morning unexpectedly Vera and I received a longletter from Aunt Patricia. We had not heard in several weeks.  In theletter she explains that she had been intending to write for some time,but was waiting until she understood more definitely what condition heraffairs were in.  She stated that she had known for some time that shehad been spending too much money and had drawn upon her capital, as wellas using her entire income.  Her lawyer has told her several times thatshe must retrench, but being Aunt Patricia she had paid no attention tohim.  Well, the climax came when Aunt Patricia learned that the home sheis erecting for war orphans in France is to cost double what she hadexpected it would cost.  The fault has been chiefly her own; she hasbeen adding all kinds of things, playgrounds and an outdoor school and aspecially fitted-up hospital for the children in a separate building.You may know more than I do about it."When she went to her lawyers with the information that she requiredtwice the sum she originally told them to raise, they declared thiscould not be accomplished without leaving her virtually penniless. Shetoo had been buying oil stock like the rest of the world, hoping to gainmore money for her orphans and the stock had turned out to be worthless."Aunt Patricia does not seem to care a great deal.  She announces thatshe has secured the necessary money for her war orphans and the buildingwill be completed with all the recent improvements.  She apologizesbecause she will not have the money to allow Vera and me continue ourcollege course when this year is over. Neither will she be able to keepup her place in Boston, but this is incidental.""Oh, that will make no special difference to Aunt Patricia, as she neverhas been fond of the place.  It was her brother’s home and they werevery different characters. She will live with me in the future."Observing Vera and Alice exchange a glance, Mrs. Burton smiled."You don’t believe she will consent to this, do you, considering thefact that she has declined to speak to me for nearly a year?Nevertheless I assure you she will. It is not worth while for you toaccompany me, Alice; I prefer to go to Boston alone. I shall bring AuntPatricia here until we make our summer plans.  I must find Mrs. Grahamnow and learn whether Aunt Patricia has written her.  Good-by."A moment later the two friends met face to face."I have been looking for you in your own room, Polly.  Come into myroom, won’t you?  I have just received a surprising letter from AuntPatricia in which she insists I am not to confide her misfortune to you.This is nonsense, when you are the one person in the world who can giveher the affection and help she requires. I don’t believe Aunt Patriciawill care particularly for the loss of her fortune if the loss restoresyou to her.""Thank you, Betty, dear, you need feel no anxiety.  Now that I may beable to do something for Aunt Patricia, and not accept everything fromher, I have not the least idea of permitting her to behave in her old,obstinate, absurd fashion.  Thank goodness, we shall be friends soonagain; no one dreams how much I have missed her during this pastwinter!""You don’t think Aunt Patricia will refuse to see you?"Polly Burton shook her head."I don’t care in the least if she does refuse at first.  There areoccasions, Betty, dear, when you know I can be as obstinate a woman asAunt Patricia Lord.  I shall be away about five days.  You will let mebring her back with me?"                             *CHAPTER XVI*                          *THE DISAPPEARANCE*"Juliet Temple has not returned, Sally.  Mother feels uneasy and told meto ask if you knew anything of her plans.  We feel especiallyresponsible now that Tante is away, as she made it a point that we wereto look after Juliet while she was gone and see that she was notlonely.""Why, what has happened, Bettina?" Sally inquired serenely.  "I am sureyou have been more than attentive for the past few days."The long twilights were beginning and with dinner over, Sally and Danwere sitting in the hammock under the linden trees, one of Sally’sfavorite resorts.The other members of the house party were in the garden, where already afew tiny spears were appearing from seeds planted but a brief time ago,so swift had been the arrival of the heat that of late there had beendays more like summer than spring."Well, perhaps Juliet was so bored with my society that she haspreferred to run away.  She told mother this morning that she wished togo to the mainland on the early boat and would be away all day. Mothermade a point of making her promise to return in the afternoon.  But nowthe last boat has come and gone and there is no chance of her reachingthe island until to-morrow, unless some friend brings her across, whichdoes not seem probable.  We might go over in the motor launch and searchfor her, but discovering her would be another matter.""Didn’t Juliet intend to spend the night away from the island?" Sallyinquired. "Otherwise why did she take her suit case? I saw her startingoff with it.""She wished to bring back her purchases and said she thought this wouldbe the simplest method of carrying them.  I declare I don’t know what weought to do. I would not for a great deal have Juliet in any difficulty;the very fact that Tante thinks we do not like her would make me moreuncomfortable if matters have gone wrong.""Is there anything I can do to be useful?" Dan asked.  "Tell Aunt Bettythat of course I am at her service."There was in Dan’s manner a constraint that puzzled Bettina, while Sallycontinued to rock idly to and fro, Dan having risen on Bettina’sarrival."You seem remarkably uninterested, Sally," she declared with unusualirritability, since ordinarily Bettina possessed a fine self-control."Sorry," Sally answered calmly, "but you see, my dear, I have aconviction that Juliet Temple is well able to take care of herself.Suppose we walk to the house, so that Dan may ask Aunt Betty if shewishes him to do anything in the matter."You and I might go up to Juliet’s room and investigate.  Endeavor todiscover if she has taken any of her belongings which might give one theidea that she planned to be away over night.""Oh, very well, Sally, although it seems unnecessary.  If Juliet wishedto remain away who would or could have objected, so what possible reasonfor secrecy?  Being a determined person, however, perhaps I had best doas you say."Dan, you will find mother in the drawing-room.  Ask her to take nosteps until Sally and I report any discovery we may make.  Has it everoccurred to you that Sally is under the impression she has a gift fordetective work?"Her speech was a perfectly idle one so Bettina was puzzled to observeSally blush uncomfortably and lower her eyes, while Dan said "No" in anannoyed tone.Ten minutes after, the two girls were standing facing each other inJuliet Temple’s room, which adjoined Mrs. Burton’s larger one."Really, Sally dear, I do not like to peer into Juliet’s private closetor bureau drawers.  Would you mind looking first, since after all I amher hostess and you are not."Sally smiled the demure smile with which she covered a number ofsituations."So, Bettina, you wish me to do something you have an aversion to doingyourself? Never mind, I don’t particularly object and you do.  Besides,the suggestion originated with me and if I am right or wrong, I shallsummon the courage to confess to Juliet, although I shall not enjoy it.I shall tell her that Aunt Betty was uneasy and we thought perhaps shehad arranged to spend the night with friends and used this method tofind out."So saying, Sally drew forth the top drawer of the mahogany chest ofdrawers, then a second and a third drawer; each and every one wasentirely empty.Without comment the two girls walked across the room and togetherunfastened the closet door; not a dress or garment of any kind hunginside."Sally, Juliet does not intend to return! _Why_, I don’t understand, wehave done our best to be courteous and she might at least have saidgood-by.  I presume she has gone to Tante’s New York apartment.  Do youthink we should telegraph and say she is no longer here."Sally shook her head."Not for the present, but of course we must tell Aunt Betty and Dan andlearn their opinion.  Wait another moment, please."Returning to the empty drawers, Sally began searching diligentlyunderneath the neatly folded papers lining each one.  Finally sheremoved them."I thought it barely possible Juliet might have left a note for Tante.She understands that she is to return in another thirty-six hours andprobably would wish to explain to her.""Here is a letter, Sally, addressed to Mrs. Richard Burton and sealedwith sealing wax!" Bettina exclaimed, having answered Sally’s suggestionby entering the adjoining room and slipping her hand under one of thepillows of Mrs. Burton’s bed."I presume this letter does inform Tante why Juliet found existence withthe Camp Fire girls by the blue lagoon so disagreeable that she couldnot endure the experience during the week of her absence.  Well, I amjust as glad we discovered the letter and grateful to you, Sally, forthe idea.  I never have pretended that you do not understand humannature better than the rest of us, although no one would guess the factexcept through long acquaintance with you.  Juliet, I suppose, neverdreamed that we would search Tante’s bed for the concealed letter and sobelieved it would not be unearthed until her return.  I don’t know whatgave me the inspiration to look there?  Personally I wish Juliet hadvanished from Tante’s life for all time, rather than until the close ofher visit to us.  Let us go down to the drawing-room and make ourreport.  I’ll bear the letter with me and see if mother thinks we shoulddare open it.""No, I do not consider it wise to open Polly’s letter," Mrs. Grahamstated ten minutes later.  "She is so unnecessarily sensitive about thegirl, I don’t wish her to feel that we regard Juliet’s behavior as morethan ordinarily discourteous.  I am relieved that she planned herdisappearance, so she is not in any trouble.  Polly will decide what isbest when she learns what Juliet wishes her to know.  Put the letter inPolly’s room, please, Bettina, dear, not under her pillow, that seems toimply secrecy; lay it upon her desk where she will be apt to observe itsoon after her arrival.  Thank goodness, she will be at home afteranother day and two nights. She has been with me so little in the pastyears I begrudge the loss of each day."Bettina sat down on the arm of her mother’s chair."Is Aunt Patricia coming with Tante, mother, you have not said?""Yes, I think so, I have had a room made ready, although in Polly’s lastletter Aunt Patricia still seemed to be arguing the question.  I neverhave had much doubt, however, that she finally would do what Pollyinsists upon."However, the battle will not be severe, as Aunt Patricia is longing tosurrender."                             *CHAPTER XVII*                              *THE RETURN*The entire house party was down at the landing to meet the little boatwhich was to bring the Camp Fire guardian back to the "House by the BlueLagoon."She was seen standing on the deck looking younger and slighter than everwith Miss Patricia Lord’s tall, gaunt figure beside her.The instant the boat reached the shore, after receiving an enthusiasticwelcome, Alice Ashton and Vera Lagerloff took Miss Patricia by the armin an effort to separate her from the others, while Bettina, Sally, MaryGilchrist, Marguerite Arnot and the two younger girls, Elce and Maida,surrounded Mrs. Burton.Mrs. Graham seized the opportunity to whisper as she kissed her friend."Hail, the conquering hero comes, Polly!" to have the other womanmurmur:"Oh, do be careful, please, Betty.  I’ll tell you everything when we arealone. You don’t know what I have been through and how little like aconqueror I feel."Then Mrs. Graham left her and supplanted Alice by Miss Patricia’s side."Don’t you think Polly is looking pretty well, Aunt Patricia?"Pausing in her long strides, Miss Patricia frowned."Fairly well, better perhaps that I expected, but never so strong as wewould have her, Betty.  However, she is a wilful woman and it cannot behelped.  It has nearly broken my heart, Betty, to have been separatedfrom her so long, and the fault was altogether her own.  Polly agreesthat it was.""Certainly, Aunt Patricia, if you and Polly feel this to be true, I haveno thought of differing with you.  Here is David Hale wanting to speakto you.  Bettina and I gave our masculine guests the instruction thismorning that they were to keep in the background until we were allowedto welcome you.  You and David are such old friends he seems not tointend to wait his turn.""I insist that Miss Patricia allow me to carry her bag.  I have seen herdecline to allow Miss Ashton or Miss Lagerloff to touch it, but whetherit contains bonds or precious stones I will not run away with it, AuntPatricia."Entering her own room, followed by Mrs. Graham and Miss Lord, Mrs.Burton moved quickly across and opened the door of the room adjoining.She then turned:"Betty, where is Juliet? I wondered why she did not come to meet me withthe other girls and now she is not in her room. Is anything the matter?"Picking up the letter from the desk Mrs. Graham extended it toward herfriend."I don’t think so, Polly, although I scarcely know.  Juliet Temple lefthere without telling me that she intended to leave; it was only a day orso ago and we decided it best to await your return.  The letter sheaddressed to you will probably explain.  We concluded that she washomesick without you here and has gone to your apartment.""I am sorry, Betty, I am afraid Juliet has not been polite, when Iespecially asked your permission to allow her to join us."Juliet Temple has written me that she has forged my check for twothousand five hundred dollars and has gone with her brother to Canada.She is perfectly frank, poor child, and tells how and why.  The fault ispartly through my carelessness!  A few days before I left Juliet askedme to sign a check for two hundred and fifty dollars for the rent of myNew York apartment.  I was in a hurry at the time and I believe took herword for it and did not look at the check.  She tells me she had soarranged that she could change the amount, which she did at once."Her brother was in the army and stationed not far from here.  She hasbeen in the habit of seeing him since we have been on the island.Juliet has always insisted that he was the one person in the world shecared for and that he had given her nothing but sorrow.  It seems thathe has been committing a number of offences and expected to becourt-martialed, but instead of submitting, had planned to desert. Forhis sake Juliet appears to have lost all sense of honor or duty towardme.  She seems convinced that I will not prosecute her.  She tells meshe was leaving immediately for New York, where she will have the checkcashed (she is in the habit of cashing my checks).  Afterwards, she andher brother intend to make their home in Canada and never return to theUnited States!  A pretty desperate situation, isn’t it?""Yes, Polly, but I’ll telegraph to Anthony in Washington and, if it canbe accomplished, he will see that the girl is found and brought back.  Iam so distressed for you, it is such a large sum of money and you havetrusted the girl so completely.""Yes, Betty, but I don’t want Juliet found and punished.  I have noright to feel or behave like this and every one of you must say exactlywhat you like to me. I know I am absolutely wrong and that she ought tobe made to suffer the legal penalty, but I simply haven’t the force ofcharacter or the courage.  I could not endure to think of a girl who hasbeen so near me, who has lived as a member of my family and been good tome in many small ways, shut up in prison for the rest of her youth.""Yes, Polly, I know, let us not talk of this now.  Painful as it is, youcannot allow yourself to be so sentimental and cowardly, dear!  Besides,the money is a great deal more than you and Richard can possibly affordto lose!""Goodness, I had forgotten that!  It is not only _more_ than we canafford to lose, it is nearly all the money we possess at present. Julietmust have known.  We saved from the amount I earned last winter onlywhat we thought sufficient to last through the summer, until I returnedto work in the autumn; the rest Richard has devoted to the payments heand I feel called upon to make.""Yes, and a nice time, Polly Burton, for you to assume the addedresponsibility of an old woman to support!" Miss Patricia said harshly."Do you think, Aunt Patricia, that this is the time for you to sayunkind things to me?  Don’t you think I have a good deal to bear andthat you might not make it harder?"Too overcome to speak, Miss Patricia nodded and actually two tearsrolled unchecked down her gaunt cheeks."I am afraid Richard will be terribly worried and annoyed over mycarelessness," Mrs. Burton said childishly."Richard Burton!  Let him dare utter a word!  Who was it brought thatunpleasant girl, whom I never liked at any time, into our home at HalfMoon Lake?  I remember his saying something or other about being aknight errant!"  Miss Patricia snorted, and the girls, Polly Burton andBetty Graham broke into hysterical laughter that saved the situation."I fear that from the first Juliet Temple realized that I was an easyperson to deceive. In her letter she also confides the fact that whenshe told me she had been wrongfully accused in her office in Washington,she did this in order that I might be impressed with the idea that shewould not have confessed had she been guilty.[*]  Well, at least Irejoice that you girls were never deceived by her and that Juliet wasnever a member of our Sunrise Camp Fire.  Let us speak of her as littleas possible in the future."[*] See "Camp Fire Girls at Half Moon Lake.""And Polly, you are not to worry over money; of course Anthony and I arenot rich, but you may have anything that we possess.  Why not make methe happiest of human beings and you and Aunt Patricia and Richard spendthe summer here with me in the ’House by the Blue Lagoon’? You may dowhatever you wish and we’ll not trouble you," Mrs. Graham urged."You are an angel, Betty, but Aunt Patricia and Richard and I must hidesomewhere where I can work and study, if I can find a play for nextwinter.  Now may I lie down for a little while?"A few moments later, in Miss Patricia’s bedroom, she and her hostesscontinued the discussion."What do you think, Aunt Patricia? Ought we allow Polly to permit thisgirl to go free, in spite of her deceit and treachery?""I don’t know what else is possible, Betty.  Polly is wrong, she nearlyalways is wrong, and yet to punish the girl would have a most disastrouseffect upon her. There is a sweetness about her and a generosity; Pollyhas been most generous and sweet to me, Betty, when I have behaved verybadly and so I would not care to influence her, if I could, to be severeupon any one else.""Don’t, Aunt Patricia, speak of yourself in any such connection!  Butabout the money, Polly will never allow us to help her.  She never wouldaccept anything from anyone save you, and now you can no longer affordto help."A moment Miss Patricia sat crumpling a large, masculine-lookinghandkerchief in her capable hands, while a flush spread over her facethat amazed her companion."Betty Graham, I desire to make a confession to you and to request youto keep my secret until such time as I may be willing to speak of itmyself.  The truth is I am not so poor as I have allowed you and Pollyand the Camp Fire girls to believe. I have lost money, my home forFrench orphans is costing twice the amount I had expected it would cost,and I have found it an excellent arrangement to rent my house nearBoston and to live as economically as possible, but I am not a pauper.Now do use your intelligence and understand why I have wished you to bedeceived."Apparently I had hopelessly estranged Polly and had reached a pointwhere I could not any longer endure being apart from her.  Some weeksago she sent me word through Richard that never so long as she livedwould she accept anything more at my hands and that she had entreated meto make friends with her for the last time.  There are occasions youknow when Polly can be singularly obstinate.  So what was I to do?Appeal to her sympathy, make her believe there was something she coulddo for me.  Mavourneen, I knew she would fly to my rescue. So I sent outthe word and she came and now I shall be parted from her no more. But,Betty, my dear, Polly shall never suffer.  Do not believe that I shallfail to keep sufficient money to see she has all she desires.  For thepresent let us have our little house and our summer together and Pollythe belief that she is caring for me. I shall dread the day when shelearns what I have told you."                            *CHAPTER XVIII*                           *THE ETERNAL WAY*    The Eternal Way lies before him,    The Way that is made manifest in the Wise.    The Heart that loves reveals itself to man,    For now he draws nigh to the Source,    The night advances fast,    And lo! the moon shines bright."Will you come into the garden for a farewell talk with me, Bettina?You know, I leave for Washington in the morning.""In a quarter of an hour, David.  I must see that my two small girls arein bed before I join you.  Suppose you wait for me on the beach near thesun dial."The night was warm and instead of sitting down David Hale walked about,thinking of a very different garden where first he had met BettinaGraham, the "Queen’s Secret Garden", near "The Little Trianon" in thegreat park at Versailles.He remembered his own surprise upon discovering an American girl halfasleep in the shadow of a group of statuary and startled intowakefulness by his unexpected approach.So their acquaintance had begun in a romantic setting that David thoughtnever to find repeated.  To-night he was by no means sure thesurroundings were not equally lovely.The moon was rising before the afterglow had wholly faded.  A lightbreeze made the delicate green leaves rustle on a hundred nearby trees,the magnolias were in bloom over the entire island, scenting the nightair with their heavy, tropical fragrance.In the moonlight and the last of the purple twilight, David Hale wasdevoting little attention to these details.  He was thinking with theconcentration over which he had a special mastery, of something hewished to say to Bettina Graham and of how he had best say it.She waved a long blue scarf as she came running down the path towardhim."I did not keep you waiting long, David, did I?  I am sorry you must goto-morrow, but then the house party will break up in another week or tendays and I am returning to New York.  After all, it is a shorter journeyfor you to come back to the ’House by the Blue Lagoon’ than for me, andyou know mother and Marguerite Arnot are always pleased to see you.  Iwish I could reach here so easily; for a number of reasons it is goingto be very hard to leave the island, our island.  I have a fashion ofsaying ’our island’ over again to myself every now and then because itseems so incredible that we can own such an exquisite spot and that itis no farther away from the outside world.  Why, except that it is nottropical, we might almost deceive ourselves into believing that we wereon one of the south sea islands!""Then why do you go, Bettina, unless you wish?  There certainly can beno other reason and your mother will be distressed at your departure.It is so impossible for me to understand your point of view.  Your homeis here and no other place can be so beautiful!""I know, David," Bettina answered gently, "and yet I have tried so oftento explain to you and to other people: beautiful as this place is andloving it as I do, yet my work and life are no more here than your own.You are going back to Washington, David; you are very ambitious and someday intend to have a political career. Suppose this were your homeinstead of mine, would you stay here always?  Would you give up yourwork and your ambition and your future to live in an island of dreams?"No, of course you would not?  Then why do you think I should?  Oh, Iknow the answer, I have gone into the subject so many times--because Iam a girl and there is no reason why I should devote myself to socialwork, when my father is a man of prominence and some wealth and mymother all that is sweet and charming and popular.  I am not going totalk about myself, only you do know my reason and you could understandmy point of view if you would make the effort.  Instead of caring lessfor my work after a few months of effort and experience, I care morethan at the beginning.""I am sorry, Bettina."Bettina laughed."Why should you be?  Mother and father are becoming more reconciled."She and David had not ceased walking now they stopped and Bettina leanedover the sun dial."I am glad our garden boasts a sun dial, as it would not be half sopicturesque without, yet the inscription is curious and taken from anancient Japanese poem, which would seem to make it a moon dial andappropriate to-night, David.  I can repeat it because I think I know thepoem by heart:    "The Eternal Way lies before him,    The Way that is made manifest in the Wise.    The Heart that loves reveals itself to man    For now he draws nigh to the Source,    The night advances fast,    And lo! the moon shines bright."See David, even in the poem the Way lies before _him_, not before_her_.""There is only one way that I wish lay before you, Bettina, the way oflearning to care for me.  Please don’t interrupt me, this cannot bealtogether a surprise to you. I think I tried to make you see how I felttoward you at the beginning of our acquaintance, although I did my bestto wait until your mother and father had learned to know something of meand until you were older.  I would wait now if you were not becoming soabsorbed in the work you have undertaken that I am afraid you will loseall interest in me.  My dear Bettina, affection is the supreme thing andif you will only wait and have faith in me, some day I may be able tooffer you a name and a future of which you may be proud."Bettina shook her head."David, I am glad you said this to me, as I wish to be perfectly frank.No, I am not altogether surprised, yet I am going to sound as if I wereunappreciative and unkind.  I not only don’t care for you in the way youdesire, but I never could learn to care.  I dread the whole thought ofromance and sincerely hope it may never come into my life.  I have mywork and my family and friends and please never speak of this again.""But if it should come, Bettina, when you are older and wiser and lessself-absorbed, would I, could I have any chance with you then?""No, David Hale, never; from the first I have never wanted you to beanything but my friend.  Please let me say good-by and good luck to you.There is some one else in the garden and I am afraid we might beoverheard.""Good-night, and good-by for a long time, Bettina.  I am sorry to havetroubled you."As Bettina ran on, Robert Burton stepped in front of her."You are not going indoors on a night like this, Miss Graham!  Why notstay and talk to me for a while?  I don’t know what the other fellow hasdone to make you in such haste, but I shall try to be more agreeable.You have been very kind to have asked me here, but I have seen less ofmy hostess than I counted on seeing."Remember when we are back in New York you have promised to take me toone of your settlement houses and make me useful, if it is possible thatan idle fellow like I am can be useful to anyone.""Yes, no, thank you, but I must go in," Bettina protested.  "Nothing hashappened, but I am in a good deal of a hurry. Why are you idle?  Pleaseunderstand I don’t wish you to help with the settlement work on myaccount, not unless you feel a deep interest in the work itself.""Yes?  Well, that is one way of stating the case," Robert Burtonanswered. "Wasn’t I a good Samaritan when you were lost in New York?"Bettina did not answer, already having vanished up the path toward thehouse.At the same moment that Bettina was escaping in one direction, MaryGilchrist was hurrying down the front lawn toward the lagoon in searchof Allan Drain.She was a good deal excited and considerably out of breath.Allan appeared extremely comfortable lying on the bottom of the anchoredboat with his face upturned to the sky."Oh, Allan, I have the most wonderful news for you!" Gill exclaimed,giving a flying leap and landing in the bottom of the boat which rockeddangerously at her descent."If you have, Gill, I think it your duty not to attempt to drown mebefore I am able to hear it," Allan expostulated, straightening up andremoving the sofa cushions upon which he had been resting and tossingone of them to Gill."Really, Gill, of late you have been returning to those boyish habitsand manners which I found so reprehensible in you at the beginning ofour acquaintance. After you have confided to me your thrillinginformation do you think you can sit calm and speechless in this boatfor the next half hour?"I had escaped from the others in order to enjoy a little peace andsolitude, which is so difficult to attain upon a house party. You maynot have intended it, but at the instant you plunged into this boat I amunder the impression that you destroyed an immortal sonnet.  I cannotrecall a line at present, that is why I feel so convinced it wasimmortal.""A thousand times I crave your pardon, Allan Drain.  You know I have afashion of banishing your poetic muse.  However, return to yourpoetizing, I can sit here in silence for a half hour or more _before_telling you my wonderful news just as readily as _after_ telling it toyou."Five minutes passed.Finally Allan yawned."See here, Gill, I think you might confide what you came to say.  I havean idea that it is of small importance--girls’ secrets usually are--butit bores me to have you sit there with your lips tightly pressedtogether, as if the words would rush through otherwise, and your facewhite and your eyes shining.  If any good fortune has come to you, Gill,please tell me.  You know how glad I shall be.""The good fortune is not mine, it is yours, only it is mine also becauseI am so glad for you.""Then let me hear what it is.  I know you too well to believe you wouldtry to deceive me," Allan answered, as if he were fighting against ahope he dared not permit himself to hold."It cannot be possible that Mrs. Burton has a good word to say for myplay!""More than that, Allan, she is very enthusiastic.  Now do keep still andI shall tell you everything I know.  The night of her return to the’House by the Blue Lagoon’, Mrs. Burton was feeling restless and unhappyover something that was troubling her a great deal, and so was unable tosleep.  She rose up out of bed and wrote a letter to her husband; whenshe had finished, as your play was in her desk, she picked it up andbegan looking it over, with no thought of actually reading it at thetime.  Something interested her, a line, or a character, and she read onuntil she had finished.  When she lay the play down and turned off theelectric light dawn had come.  Still she remained unable to sleep.""You mean she was thinking of my play?""Yes, Allan, I do mean that, she was thinking of it, but she wasdistrusting her own judgment and determined to wait until a day or morehad passed in order to read the play again before arriving at a decisionor speaking to any one concerning it."This afternoon she read it for the second time and after dinner askedMrs. Graham and Aunt Patricia and me to come into her sitting-room.  Sheexplained that she asked me rather than any one of the other Camp Firegirls, because of late we have appeared to be special friends andbecause accidentally I gave your play its title: ’The Red Flower’.  Shetold me I was to come and tell you how much she liked it before shespoke to you herself, so that perhaps you would forgive me for the lossof your poems a year ago."Allan, why don’t you say something? What is the matter?  I simply go ontalking in this stupid fashion because you won’t speak.""I can’t, Gill, not for a moment, the wonder and surprise and happinessare too great.  Now Mrs. Burton likes my play I shall be willing toconsign it to the flames from whence it received its name.""Foolish boy, do you suppose I believe you?  I ought not to tell youthis, because I was not given the right, although no one said I must notspeak of it.  Mrs. Burton wants to play ’The Red Flower’ next winter, ifher manager thinks the play half so fine as she thinks it.  She is totelegraph him in the morning to come to the island and give her hisopinion.  If they agree she wants to remain here on the island in one ofthe small fishermen’s cottages, which can be done over, and study andwork for a part of the summer.  There will probably be changes that mustbe made, so she wants you to spend a part of the time here if it ispossible for you."There was no reply, save that leaning over, Allan lifted the anchor.Then taking both oars he pulled rapidly out into the centre of the bluelagoon and onward toward the bay."Don’t be frightened, Gill, I’ll not get into a difficulty to-night.This is the greatest moment of my life and I cannot sit still and acceptit calmly.

General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronicworks.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright inthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do notnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBooknumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed._Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:    http://www.gutenberg.orgThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, includinghow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary ArchiveFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe toour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
